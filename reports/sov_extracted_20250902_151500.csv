Bhai 2 sal me hi kharab ho gaya..😢 aaj repairing wala aane wala hai dekhta hu kitna kharcha aata.
I bought atomberg halo  today i returned atomberg. Fan's rpm is low, does not justify its price
How to order?
Exactly
Hows the user experience?
only 1500 rupees per year?
Saving ⚡️ me 😊
Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can't hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me
Kya kehna chahte ho bhai?😂
Color konsa hai?
Please please do not buy bldc fan.
Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai. Jo 20 sal tak bhi chal jata hai..  phir bldc jhatu lene ka kya fayda..???
Repair cost very high...1000-1300 rs approx 😢

I bought Renesa+ 1400 mm for 194sq.ft. living room. The airflow is felt only below the fan. If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot. Noise is a bit more than normal fans.

If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot.

Nahi brother..., atomberg renesa ko google assistant or alexa se control karna possible nahi hain!
                                           only IR(Infra Red) enabled mobile se control kar sakte ho aap.
Lekin mera pass ye bala fan nahin hain😢😢
Koi baat nahi..., kabhi kharid lena aap future me 🙂
@@AmazingTechniqueGyan bro kya main tumhara video edit kar sakta hu ❤️‍🔥
Yes bro. kar sakte ho... koi dikkat nahi, but same to same mat daal dena, apna effort daalna bohot zaroori hota hain bro...., like- voice over, collab etc.
@AmazingTechniqueGyan  Reply Bro
@AmazingTechniqueGyan  bro bas tumhe mujhe apna video bhej dena jisse edit karna hai  aur apna voice ok
How is this fan, is this still in good condition?
Yes!
But there are few things you should know..., 
I am using two atomberg bldc fans... first one is 2.2 years old (atomberg renesa) and second one is 1.5 years old (atomberg renesa smart). Both fans are running absolutely fine in my case..., but my cousine is using renesa and facing PCB speed control issues from the beginning. 
                                   As per my knowledge, If you purchase it from a trusted and reliable shopping platform so you are less likely to get future issues.

Thanks!
Apps kounsa install kre
""Atomberg Home"" app.
Offline milega kya ? Or price kitna hoga
Ha offline miljayega..., and price ₹4000 ke andar.
bhai kitne rupees kya hei
4000 rupees ka hain ye, agar apko chahiye ye to main link dedunga apko.
Ye renesa smart hai yaa renesa smart plus
Ye ""Renesa Smart"" hain..., isko aap google assistant and alexa se control kar sakte hain.
Open box delivery ke time acchese ap fan ko check kar lena..., kyun ki atomberg ka fans me manufacturing defects bohot aa raha aaj kal!
Mobile se connect karne ke liye kuch alag se kuch  magana padega kya
Nahi, mobile se connect karne ke liye alag se kuch bhi nahi karna padega, sirf ""atomberg home"" app ko install karke simply connect kar sakte ho aap.
@AmazingTechniqueGyan  abhi kaise hai fan
Main pichle 2 saal se use kar raha hoon..., fan ka sabkuch thik thak hain but kabhi kabhi knock knock sound ata hain.

Regulator connection remove cheyyalaaa?

Good work
Thank you
question 1- If I want to change the fan speed from 1 to 5.  direct change or gradual change (2->3>4>5) what should I do???
Questiin 2 - Does direct change affect  fans??? 
 Question  3 - A fan has initiated  a problem.  The fan speed automatically becomes up and down with irrespective  time gap. Customer support send a technician ,he observed and nothing errors has found. The technician says that is a voltage fluctuation but the other  rest of the atomberg fan speed  does not become ups and down at the same time.

what is the main reason??
Remove regulater ur fan

Correct
Atomberg renesa ka yeh model behtreen tha jisme PCB uper lga rehta hai, New wala model ab bahut ghatiya hai purane wale se speed kam hai Air Flow bhi kam hai. Mujhe new model renesa ka bilkul pasand nhi aaaya, mere pass old model the lekin woh khatam ho gye the toh replacment mein mujhe new model mile meine old model ki bola toh bole ki ab discontinued ho chuke hain toh mein unhe use ker rha lekin purane wale ke compare mein yeh kuch bhi nhi 😔

Regulator connection remove cheyyalaaa?
Yes box meedhey vuntundhi
No it should be a direct connection
Regulator avasaram Ledhu e fans ki
Good work
Thank you
question 1- If I want to change the fan speed from 1 to 5.  direct change or gradual change (2->3>4>5) what should I do???
Questiin 2 - Does direct change affect  fans??? 
 Question  3 - A fan has initiated  a problem.  The fan speed automatically becomes up and down with irrespective  time gap. Customer support send a technician ,he observed and nothing errors has found. The technician says that is a voltage fluctuation but the other  rest of the atomberg fan speed  does not become ups and down at the same time.

what is the main reason??
Remove regulater ur fan

@@BoyasMondal esc is the electronic speed controller. The pcb is faulty which is sending false signals to the esc due to which speed is changing

Why directly
​@@govindphapale.6027 Voltage regulation is not good on dc motor.

Nahi . Wo company ka naam dekho upar wale cup par hai wo niche lagane par ulta ho jayega
Bro it doesn't need regulator 😅
Yes bro if we already have a regulator connection, can't we Just put 5 speed in the regulator and control the speed via remote
​@@manojmark2372It will just make your fan malfunction and unable to work properly. Best option to disconnect regulator for bldc fan.

Just remove fan regulator and make it direct

😥i returned fan bcoz of the speed...i thought it was defective and giving less airflow
High airflow than normal
Low evn in boost mode

Don't buy BLDC or whatever technology....It saves energy more efficiently than traditional fan but once it stops working your repairing cost is more than whatever you have saved in energy, especially Automberg after sales is very poor ..... Think before buy.....

Regulator connection remove cheyyalaaa?
Yes box meedhey vuntundhi
No it should be a direct connection
Regulator avasaram Ledhu e fans ki
Good work
Thank you
question 1- If I want to change the fan speed from 1 to 5.  direct change or gradual change (2->3>4>5) what should I do???
Questiin 2 - Does direct change affect  fans??? 
 Question  3 - A fan has initiated  a problem.  The fan speed automatically becomes up and down with irrespective  time gap. Customer support send a technician ,he observed and nothing errors has found. The technician says that is a voltage fluctuation but the other  rest of the atomberg fan speed  does not become ups and down at the same time.

what is the main reason??

One Star – Extremely Disappointed with After-Sale Service

I rarely write reviews, but the after-sale service for this ceiling fan has been beyond frustrating. The fan itself worked fine for about a month, and then it started making a loud clicking noise. I contacted customer support, and that’s where the real nightmare began.

It took over a week just to get a response, and even then, it was a generic reply asking for details I had already provided. After multiple follow-ups, they finally agreed to send a technician—who never showed up. Rescheduled three times, and each time they either didn’t show up or cancelled last minute with no explanation.

It’s been nearly two months now, and the issue is still unresolved. I’ve wasted time, energy, and money on something that should’ve been a simple fix. Terrible customer service, no accountability, and zero urgency. I would NOT recommend this brand to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.

I always thought they were a BIG FAILURE. Thank God they confirmed it..
the only design failure was the front panel that defeats the whole purpose. the motor was always awesome that atomberg provided. i have this fan and use it with that panel removed. they couldhve provided grill because not everything has to be minimalistic and boring. for what they offered the fan is dead silent and very very efficient (just 6 watts!)
How about if you don’t point the smoke directly at the exhaust, so we can see exactly how good it performs 🤔
Was thinking the same thing haha 😂
I planned to buy it in online. I am glad I went to  store and checked its function 😂. This is not a good exhaust fan as it has very low suction capacity which is the primary role of an exhaust rather than looks 😂. Think wisely and buy even efficio model of atomberg which has better suction
From so closeby.....even a computer cabinet fan will suck this much. This doesnt mean shot about how much air in a room it will move out in a certain space of time.
Itne paas te karoge to Mera 699 rupay wala exhaust bhi itna hi kaam karega😂😂😂

I bought Renesa+ 1400 mm for 194sq.ft. living room. The airflow is felt only below the fan. If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot. Noise is a bit more than normal fans.

I am very sad from this company how to sholve my problem ? pl help me",,u_kxhHjHln0,"I bought Renesa+ 1400 mm for 194sq.ft. living room. The airflow is felt only below the fan. If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot. Noise is a bit more than normal fans.

Atomberg is making noise. After frequent service , the noise is same. I think conventional fan are cheaper & good air supply.
Last month I went Sowcarpet, Chennai to buy 3 BLDC fans. I asked for Orient or Crompton fans, but shop owner convince me to buy Atomberg. I ignored his suggestion and brought fans in another shop.
Atomberg built and performance quality is too bad. But paid promoters are feeding fake information in social media. Be aware.
Crompton fan introduced 35 watts convention fan, which will replace BLDC and performance also good.

And there is a brand who invented the technology - Superfan. It’s not even in the list. Atomberg started making issues while superfan with extensive usage still runs better without any issues

Atomberg dont have good air delivery as I am using last one year if you seat under the fan then only u will feel cooling
same  problem with havells

The mentioned KW is power consumption not the power......less KW means less power consumption and more savings on your electricity bill
Thank u very much.  It's very good comparison.
How come you neglected the Activa  BLDC fan brand by just showing negative comments.. I can show you a number of negative comments about all the four brands you mentioned. This is not your unbiased video. There is no problem doing sponsored branding but this is not the right way as you have shown in the video..people are not fool.
You have left out Coimbatore based  Super phone, the pioneer in BLDC fan technology

There is one brand named ""Super"" from Coimbatore, Tamilnadu which is origin for all these. You conveniently avoided this. Super is the best and no other brands can match
I have both brand,  I'm suffering from superfan. Very very poor support , fan remote failed in a month, and it is not under warranty.
Y superfan is in list? Not even in rejection list
Atomberg is having 28 watts model
Bro what about Vgurd bldc
regulator control BLDC fans available?
No. In fact, using them without a regulator is better for power efficiency and the safety of the internal components of the fan. Mostly the power efficiency.

Atomberg is making noise. After frequent service , the noise is same. I think conventional fan are cheaper & good air supply.
Last month I went Sowcarpet, Chennai to buy 3 BLDC fans. I asked for Orient or Crompton fans, but shop owner convince me to buy Atomberg. I ignored his suggestion and brought fans in another shop.
Atomberg built and performance quality is too bad. But paid promoters are feeding fake information in social media. Be aware.
Crompton fan introduced 35 watts convention fan, which will replace BLDC and performance also good.
@@kavinkhumar3751 Should I go with Orient ujala prime bldc fan or atomberg renesa prime bldc fan? Thank you
Which conventional model from Crompton consumes 35 watts?
don't buy fans from Flipkart . There replacement policy is very messy and they will not replace at any cost. I bought 8 fans and my 2 fans were defective and Flipkart refuses to replace my order
@@gautamsinghrathore6304 50 + fan order no issue in brand fan 🙂
@@gautamsinghrathore6304 same with me also.they sent defactive fan and refused to return inspite of sending unboxing video.
Mera bhi Flipkart order on the way, plz suggest what I should do?
I have got defective fan.tried to replace but they refused.now after 1.8 year of use fan out of order.they have no policy to replace after company issued replacement letter no dealer accepting the letter saying you have not buyed from me so not going to give replacement.you have to go flipkart.
And there is a brand who invented the technology - Superfan. It’s not even in the list. Atomberg started making issues while superfan with extensive usage still runs better without any issues
Yes copy is more popular than original. Fake id more valuable than real. 😢
Best is conventional fan rock,long life  and sturdy for Indian power condition.
I have been using  superfan in three bedrooms for the past 12 years without any issues, recently bought a n Atomberg fan and had to return it immediately due to humming noise and swaying.
@@shibujoseph1134 which model you used ?
Without the comparison with superfan, your presentation is incomplete.
Shows lack of info or promotion. 😂
Purchased Havells Ambrose slim 6 months ago. My best purchase ever amog fans
@@the_trader_way Could you please give your review on the fan
I am confused between havella ambrose slim and orient i tome
Noise & speed kesi he??
First supplier super fan. Super
I am not convinced BLDc fan are energy saving my doubt is they are less air delivery and says energy saving.
Atomberg dont have good air delivery as I am using last one year if you seat under the fan then only u will feel cooling
same  problem with havells
I am Getting good Airflow no problem For me.Its the best fan forever❤❤❤
The mentioned KW is power consumption not the power......less KW means less power consumption and more savings on your electricity bill
Thank u very much.  It's very good comparison.
How come you neglected the Activa  BLDC fan brand by just showing negative comments.. I can show you a number of negative comments about all the four brands you mentioned. This is not your unbiased video. There is no problem doing sponsored branding but this is not the right way as you have shown in the video..people are not fool.
You have left out Coimbatore based  Super phone, the pioneer in BLDC fan technology
Atomberg renesa fan poor bearing one bearing makes too much noise upto speed 1to 4
very informative 👍👍👍
Thank you so much for clearly explained and compared.. I was thinking to buy  ceiling fan.. It's very useful.. As you said I always preferred branded items only due to life long usuage.. I like this video very much.. I subscribed your channel.. Keep on move..
I am using atomberg rensa plus 4 fans in my house its been 4 years now .one of the fan stopped working I called the customer care they replaced my fan within 2 days no questions asked .and after that I trusted the service and also suggested my relatives . And in total in have bought more than 12 fans for my self and familyembers.
The connectivity with Alexa is also great 
Love atomberg.
Now make me the brand embarrassed for the atomberg ❤
@@mohammedsajjadali3635 same here... My fan got spoiled by thunder lightning and after complaining they replaced it with no questions asked but only the motor... Blades were not replaced
Air delivery kaisi hai? Any other issues plz explain.
Why your voice is shaky ? Or voice module
Useful information 👍
polycab is very good
which fan got thicker fan blades after few days of usage fan blades go for toss fan rotates but no air
Thank you for sharing ❤

Thanks for the very detailed comparison!!
Bldc fan has many electronic components.  So its life expectancy is very short. It ie also very expensive to repair.
It has a simple rectifier circuit with built in surge protection and a speed controller. 

Nothing rocket science. 
Life expectancy is as long as you don’t get extreme surge currents (which in case of a normal fan generally burns the copper windings which is more expensive than repairing the rectifier circuit of a BLDC.
Hats off bro.. Very nice
Lovely explanation. Sweet & simple.
Very good comparison... Thanks...

Hey thanks for making such informational videos.
Can you please make a video on how do we check our power voltage at our home.
Also I wanted to know if there is any products where we can check the voltage
Thanks for your feedback!

Why mentioned in bldc ceiling fan battery powered 
It's Ac to Dc to convert or what ?
what's the difference in higher voltage or uf of a replacement capacitor for ceiling fan?? English please!
It doesn't matter if i have already invested in household Solar energy and also more components and more maintainance of bldc fans is expensive......just get solar and get cost effective for everything else
Top most issue of rpm of fan..you didn't explained........whyy...?

What about BLDC Vs Normal fan reparing cost ?
I think not more then 7k, so don't worry and go for BLDC
I got normal fan for 1800, and power consumption is 42w

So I went with it than a BLDC fan
Does BLDC fans Have Humming Sound in Low Speed Like Normal Fans with regulators ??
No.. koi sound nahi aata kisi bhi speed par.

Bro don't fool people. At cost of 1700 we csn get a normal fan with 56 watt energy consumption conpated to 32 watt BLDC fan. So it's expensive that too in long term as the money in my bank will also increase. BLDC is good but not the replacement for fans
How about service?
Will local electricians be able to repair the bldc fans?
Yess

Their speed is slow compared to three blade fans
Indian populace who haven't used bldc fans still think HIGH RPM means High air delivery. It's not. High RPM only causes High Noise and low air delivery while consuming more power. A good modern fan should consume less power and Deliver MORE AIR DOWNWARD WITH LESS RPM this having low noise and smooth breeze like air throughout the room. These fans deliver that much air with much less RPM hence they are great to have. 
This more blade fans are for cold environment is a false thought that most Indians who haven't used such a appliance think but once they experience it they understand why it's better and why it's SO EXPENSIVE. 
The price is it's only downside.
@@debdulalsenapati1391 either you have not used multi blade fan or you have very low ceiling small room.
@@vishalpratap6991 I have not used 8 blade BLDC fan yet but have used 6 blade one in a Regular 14*13 room and the air throughput of a 6 blade dc fan is quite good along with another 4 blade BLDC fan I use. I feel both provide almost equal air delivery but the 6 blade one does it in lower RPM. That's my observation of it. 
Theoretically and as Written on the specs a 8 blade fan will provide similar air delivery at  a Slightly lower or equal as 6 blade air delivery. That's what I think it will be judging by the 6 blade performance but I feel a 6 blade fan is enough in place of 8 blade. 

The goal is to run the fan in lower RPM and get a nice Air Circulation Breeze instead of having High RPM Noise and irregular hot n cold air circulation in the Room.  

Do tell about  your Experience of any higher blade fan experience.

The thing with air circulators is that they propel the air in a vortex-action, which can travel longer distances. The vortex can bounce off other objects and walls in the room until it is eventually sucked back in through the back of the air circulator. Fans can also work to circulate air in a room, they just don’t propel the air as far and as efficiently as air circulators.
Air Circulators are best used near AC vents. Their blades are pitched in a way to throw air at a further distance and it gives the room a nice chill feeling when it bounces the walls. I’ve saved a bit on my electrical bill cause the AC doesn’t turn on as often. For reference I use a Vornado 279TR and a WooZoo Globe Fan. Both were bought from Costco. I’ve also owned a Vornado 660 but gave it to my uncle to use it in combination with his Mini Split.
Thank you for sharing this advice with everyone!
Ok I see, for something like that it could be useful
Bought a Meaco air circulator to replace my fan. It does make the room feel fresher and is far quieter. Worth the extra doe imo.
Fans do not change the temperature of the air they move in front of them, not even cooling it at all. Some more powerful fans may even heat up the room simply bcs of the electric motor producing heat due to its long term work. 

More understandable...

A traditional fan wont chnage the temperature of the air unless there is somethinf to take away the energy from the air thats being moved (such as a radiator with cold liquid inside of it). 

About the fans, there different types, more blades, less blades and more

Shorter less fans means less resistance allowing the use of motors from anywhere between 10W-50W. The fans with more blades usually come also at a bigger size and are paired with motors from anywhere between 60W up to 300W.
Material of the fans also has its differences. Plastic fans dont allow to be made super thin simply bcs the plastic will degrade quicker and will also be weak when move with a great speed. Metal fans are the best, even tho they are a bit louder. They can be made super thin which removes most of the friction with the air therefore being able to push more air while spinning at lower rpm (And here 3 blades desing is actually the more preferred, bcs its the cheapest and as efficient). The fans that come with more fan blades are usually the ones used in big barns, factories and other and therefore they are labeled as heavy industries fans or blowers. 

Dont think that the air moved by your fan is colder, the fact is that when the air is staying at one place without being moved at all for a long time, the moisture in it tends to stack at a single place also in a big quantity. What the fan does is by moving the air it makes sure that all the moisture doesnt build up in the room (in particular at a stationary position in the air even close to the ceiling of the room).
Fan blades move the air with certain pressure, this pressure exactly is what makes that refreshing feeling of being hit by a breeze, even tho its the exact same temperature as of outside. And the outer temp is usually a lot bigge if there is sun (if it says its 35°C, standing on the ground where the sun has heated up everything the temp will be around 4-8°C higher.
Totally agree! Fans don’t actually cool the air, they just move it around and make it feel cooler on your skin because of the airflow. Love the breakdown you shared on blade types and materials too, super interesting!
At 1:13 the statement on the screen says ""they won't change the temperature of the whole room"", when in actual fact they won't change the temperature in ANY part of the room, fans and air circulators don't lower the temperature of the air they're moving they just move it and it's the users perception of the way the moving air feels that makes them think the temperature has fallen, you should know this.

You don't cool a room with a vent unless it has a source of cold air. A fan cools you by moving air around you, removing your heat of your boundary layer on the skin and favouring evaporation.

Both will circulate (circular movement) the air. While it propels a volume in one direction, the air around it comes back to the intake in a 3d circular movement.
Totally agree. Fans don’t cool rooms, they cool people. It’s all about airflow and how it feels on your skin. Appreciate the insight!

It's a play of words !  A fan is a fan unless you categorize the application like a chicken is chicken unless you categorize a hen from a rooster !  An air circulator is basically a more powerful fan normally with metal blades and higher rpm and much nosier than a standard run of the mill residential fan.

FYI a fan/air circulator cant cool a room since the air they blow will always be the room temperature air.

Fans cool you (not the room) by helping you shed body heat (in humid air removing your heat bubble and in dry air increasing your sweat evaporation).
our body heat and exhaled air (higher CO2 concentration)  is trapped inside a room over time, raising the overall temperature of the room. if you put an air circulator near window or door, it can introduce air from outside of the house (which is cooler) to partially replace the existing warm air stuck in the house, thereby cooling the room. the air will also feel fresher because less CO2 concentration
@@86soulxThe video was stating that fans cool the air in the room hence my correction.

Of course opening a window will cool the room as long as the air outside is cooler as the air inside the room. 

You dont need to buy  a fan that saysair circulator to draw outside air, regular fans work just fine.

Putting the fan by the window is a poor choice in airflow dynamics since it actually draws almost half of the air from the sides and front of the fan blade. The most effective way to draw in air through window is using negative pressure by keeping the fan inside the room you want to cool (30cm from doorway) but aiming the air toward outside of the room into the hallway (also open a secondary window in separate room for the airflow to continue).
@@Eagle-Striker well the way i see it is fans can cool a room,  but only under certain conditions, such as it must draw air into the room or out of the room. 

just like technically speaking air con also doesn't cool the room if it doesn't expel the hot air out of the room through an exhaust or vent. but normally we don't say air con doesn't cool the room because it does, under certain conditions.

and yeah you put fans *near the windows , not at the windows.for optimal effect.
@@86soulx 
1. Placing a fan at or near a window with the goal of drawing in air is less effective unless you seal the fan tightly in the window. Otherwise, standard fans draw a significant portion of air from the sides and front, which reduces the amount of actual outdoor air pulled in. That’s why putting the fan at the doorway (blowing out into a hallway) works better — it pulls in outside air through the window more reliably, especially when cross-ventilation is possible.

2. On air conditioners:
Regarding ACs — actually, not all ACs expel hot air from inside the same space. For example, split system ACs have an indoor unit that cools the room and an outdoor condenser unit that releases the extracted heat. So in that case, the room is being cooled, but the heat is being expelled elsewhere. That’s still a form of heat rejection — just not through a vent inside the same space.
@@Eagle-Striker yes, thank you i'm aware of the finer details and science behind fans and air cons. i was mostly commenting on why i think saying fan or air circulator is able to cool the air in a room could be valid as long as we consider the conditions on how they can be made to achieve that

Fans change the temperature? How? They just move the air
Yeah, apologies for that! That was a mistake on our end with the script for the video.
​@@homecapricehcobviously these people have never heard of wind chill effect. Its like this. If it feels colder than it is colder!
Wind chill effect! Uh duh!
they produce heat and only move a tiny amount of air that's not strong enough to blow the heat out of the room
Wind chill has does not affect the room temperature in any way, in fact when the video says ""it blow cold air"" that is only correct if the air is cold to begin with so it' is not objectively colder.
However if you are being hit directly by the fan it moves the hotter air near the skin allow it to transfer more heat to the ""new"" air thus increasing the skins heat transfer, makin YOU be relatively colder. So @iHorus is correct, it does not change THE temperature.
Air circulators for the win
Totally agree! They move air way more efficiently!
I think the whole premise behind an air circulator is kind of nonsense. It obviously cools you down the most when it’s pointed directly at you, just like any old fan. Only difference is that it’s more quiet and pushes more air. And in my experience traditional fans tend to develop a lot of annoying noises after a bit of use—rattling, clanking, motor whine. Makes it impossible to sleep with them on.
Wrong. Air circulators DISTRIBUTE the air around a room efficiently, effectively  balancing out the temp in the whole room while traditional fans focus on the area they are pointed on, cooling that area but warming up the places it is not pointed at, causing temp difference. An air circulator is like an open light bulb that illuminates the entire room while a fan is like a strong flashlight that beams to only where you point at it. Try it in a big room with an AC. The entire room cools faster with a circulator than with a traditional fan.
Well said! I have a Vornado 660, air circulater. A big difference between a regular fan. ​@@rovicjanrafaelroa8296
Circulaters eventually rattle and make noise too. With AC you don't need more than an average fan anyway.
did i just see a PAP logo ?
I don’t understand how they are different. Aren’t they both spinning blades that push air? How can one perform different?
A traditional fan pushes air in one direction. An air circulator pushes the air all around the room and not focused in one direction, causing the air to circulate.
i love how the brand name is just ""brand"" 😂 nice touch
air circulators are just rechargeable fans but bigger and use an ac current.
A fan and air circulator are the same thing. What do you think a fan does? It moves the air. 😂 When was the last time anyone has ever said? Let's buy an air circulator? I have never heard anyone say that. Im sure some company out there probably makes a fan and calls it a air circulator though, probably hoping some poor sap, will buy it thinking its something special.
They move air at different rates. A circulator as the name implies moves them farther, they're actually more effective at moving air around than oscillating fans. They're especially effective if you have ventilation areas (e.g. window, fireplace / heater, AC) and want to evenly cool the room. You can imagine air circulators as lightbulbs (air circulator) where it lights up the whole room vs a flashlight (desk fan) that lights up a section of space. 

It's why in industrial rooms you get an air circulator sucking up outside / AC air towards the work room as it cools the room evenly vs a directional fan that needs to be pointed directly at the workbench which may cause issues (e.g. tools, dust, papers, get blown off)
​@ryoukokonpaku1575 what about drum fans
@@ryoukokonpaku1575 They should lower the prices. It is just need different shape of the fan & they rising the price just because. In my place, the price vs traditional fan is 4-7 times the price which is insane

Hello Saumya, Namaskara! I’m in the middle of a home makeover and in a unique position where I need to buy a fan, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and mixie. I spent this weekend watching your videos, and I must say they are incredibly interesting! Your in-depth research really stands out, and it clearly reflects in the quality of your content. Thank you for all the effort you put in—it’s been extremely helpful!
Namaskara! So glad to hear that 💜
Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don’t have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn’t as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won’t necessarily save you money — because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.
Is this the case with all BLDC Fan Manufacturers? Does PCB go quite often? What is the approx replacement / service costs that you incur everytime?
@@Kumar-zx8mj no, it's not often. I have 2 old Atomberg Gorilla series ceiling fan and they are running fine without any problem for last 8 years. I'll suggest you to go for the basic models instead of premium models as, the basic models last longer.

In case your PCB gone then, if you find a good electronics engineer, he can fix that at much lower cost instead replacing the faulty PCB. Generally it has 2 part, one SMPS module to convert AC to DC and a driver unit to run the brush-less motor. I had to change the driver unit once for a Atomberg Renesa Ceiling fan and it cost me about 700-800 rupees. For another pedestal model as Atomberg did not provide support saying it is discontinued, I purchased one PCB from Amazon which costs me about 1000 rupees and, I was able to fix that fan with help of that.

Hi!

Do you have any recommendation for bread makers with bread pans that are not teflon coated
Used superfan, atomberg and crompton. One of my Superfan has been running for the past 10 years on top of it has india made motor. Found Crompton to be a bit glitchy, speed drops randomly. Also have an atomberg exhaust fan but noticed it has a Chinese motor. I personally find BLDC fans to be a bit noisy especially at lower speeds. A big plus for bldc fans is the speed regulation,it is accurate and steady as compared to the usual regulators that fail in a few months.
Thank you so much for making it! ❤
Very useful ! Love your explanation and the research gone behind it.

How does it fare with your recommended premium fans can you plz tell what is the difference? Which one should one should one buy for hall I have 156 sq ft hall and budget around 5k to 6k.
Can you suggest some budget decorative fans for the living room.
Thanks a lot for all the research and suggestions.  Setting up a new home so would use your affiliate links for maximum purchase.  

1400mm sweep size fans have bad ratings across brands at Amazon. Would you recommend any in budget?
Upfront saving in 10 years. Do you think bldc fans that too in 2025 where profits > reliability will let you run anything till 10 years ?
Any bldc ceiling fan without Remote? Wil operate in regulator only?
What about fans with underlights? Is there any fan with an underlight that does not strobe? Please let us know.
How about superfan q series mam. It covers 260cmm with 270rpm . Is it good?
Best fan
Nice information
Can you please recommend whether i should buy orient aerosense or atomberg aris starlight ? Both are of similar price and offer similar features the atomberg has high number number of reviews . Orient one doesn't have a lot of reviews . I am so confused... Lots of love❤❤
Konsa liya fir... I am also in the middle of confusion
​@@abheethakkermaine atomberg wala le liya kyuki aerosense ke koi reviews nhi the , voh badhiya chal rha hai ab
Good info. Ecolink (Formerly Philips Lighting) also has good collection of BLDC fans with reverse mode and 5 years warranty but doesn't support IOT. Please consider reviewing it.
Hi what is your view of Havells Stealth Air
The superfan has the low rpm compared to atomberg compare and see the fans and give suggedtions
Rpm is not the only aspect to consider ☺️
If you had mentioned the noise level bB it would have been nice comparison
Thanks
Can u do a video of electricity consumption of lg dryers… I bought lg dryer but I don’t know which mode uses low electricity… please help
Hello Saumya Maam, Which Fan do you suggest for the quietest performance with electricity saving , I am ok spending little more on the purchase
Surprised you didn't mention Goldmedal fans, especially the Opus Prime model with 5 years warranty. 215 CMM , 350 RPM and 30W power consumption.
Can i consider LONGWAY company BLDC fan. Please suggest.
Taught of buying atomberg aris starlight instead of aris contour my main goal is high air delivery and air delivery is utmost important can I buy this BLDC fan is aris starlight or any other please recommend
Atomberg has stopped manufacturing the Renesa model.💔",,NDKD-B_i3mg,"❄Airflow vs noise – What’s more important to you in a fan?
Click here 👆for best ceiling fans https://amzn.to/4bMNptr
I'm using 3 atomberg fans (5 years old) and 2 super fan, atomberg had 3 warranty claims in first 3 years due to faulty / melted PCB on 2 fans which were used in living room and recently at its 5th year started bearing failure costing 1500 rupees per fan and this is when used for more than 12 hours a day but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer as the 3rd fan had no issues.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use I prefer a BLDC fan with longer warranty period , but the Atomberg brand service is definitely descent in Chennai.
⚠️ I'm using atomberg Fan for 1 year Renesa Smart ceiling fan 1200mm( wifi support) & Renesa Regular ceiling fan 1200mm😔, Don't Buy this both model👎, wifi & Remote control feature is great 👍 but no air flow, only in 5 speed & Boost mode you'll feel the air with fan rotating noise, Think before you buy, Don't fall in trap
Atomberg Less air flow with energy savings,
I bought 3 atomberg fan now i regret it , Do not buy atomberg fan the material of the body very chip within a year it broke after complain they change it , three year of use all of my fan having issue speed goes up and down .
Think twice before buy atomberg
Dont waste your money on atomberg there is other choice in the market
I've 4 Atomberg fans and they are working good. Speed is decent and blow is also good. I've Aris, and Renesa both are studio smart. Would recommend
Great, thanks for sharing!
Common problem is replacement waste. These companies should provide replacement discount and take back old. BLDC will penitrate more than someone want new fan for new flats😢
Truee
For the first time I felt that I have to click on the affiliate link in the video to buy a product. Very useful information. Thank you. Ordered atomberg via your link
Glad to be of help. 👍
6:13 Recently I bought this Activa Gracia fan, It has Reverse Mode.
This fan is very good. But not experienced about customer service till now
Thanks for sharing!
Hello Saumya, Namaskara! I’m in the middle of a home makeover and in a unique position where I need to buy a fan, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and mixie. I spent this weekend watching your videos, and I must say they are incredibly interesting! Your in-depth research really stands out, and it clearly reflects in the quality of your content. Thank you for all the effort you put in—it’s been extremely helpful!
Namaskara! So glad to hear that 💜
Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don’t have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn’t as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won’t necessarily save you money — because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.
Is this the case with all BLDC Fan Manufacturers? Does PCB go quite often? What is the approx replacement / service costs that you incur everytime?
@@Kumar-zx8mj no, it's not often. I have 2 old Atomberg Gorilla series ceiling fan and they are running fine without any problem for last 8 years. I'll suggest you to go for the basic models instead of premium models as, the basic models last longer.

In case your PCB gone then, if you find a good electronics engineer, he can fix that at much lower cost instead replacing the faulty PCB. Generally it has 2 part, one SMPS module to convert AC to DC and a driver unit to run the brush-less motor. I had to change the driver unit once for a Atomberg Renesa Ceiling fan and it cost me about 700-800 rupees. For another pedestal model as Atomberg did not provide support saying it is discontinued, I purchased one PCB from Amazon which costs me about 1000 rupees and, I was able to fix that fan with help of that.
Quality Content, Point to Point Explanation 
Thanks 👍
Great Explanation and Quality Content,
recommend fans for kitchen or small rooms ❤
Thunderstorm resistance is my main concern when considering a BLDC fan, due to frequent lightning in my area during monsoon🥲
I must shortlist as this is the best comparison video I have ever seen
Good video mam
Looks you have put lot of effort to do it🎉🎉
Really curious, as of where KHUL fans stand in the competition and why.. can you share YOUR view point? BTW you do a fantastic job here, enlightening our knowledge base 👏🙏
Your efforts& research behind such a video is  commendable
Hi!

Do you have any recommendation for bread makers with bread pans that are not teflon coated
Used superfan, atomberg and crompton. One of my Superfan has been running for the past 10 years on top of it has india made motor. Found Crompton to be a bit glitchy, speed drops randomly. Also have an atomberg exhaust fan but noticed it has a Chinese motor. I personally find BLDC fans to be a bit noisy especially at lower speeds. A big plus for bldc fans is the speed regulation,it is accurate and steady as compared to the usual regulators that fail in a few months.
Thank you so much for making it! ❤
Very useful ! Love your explanation and the research gone behind it.
TY SO MUCH.  UR VIDEOS R TO GOOD. I BOUGHT BOSCH INDUCTION HOB AND GAS HOB AFTER WATCHING UR VIDEOS !!!!! THANKS A TONNEE !. GONNA FINALISE FANS TOO !!
Very helpful,  especially for regions with power cuts and require battery back up
@TheGrapevineIndia Any recommendations for 1400 mm? Also if we want same design in 900mm,1200mm and 1400mm?
Helpful Thanks, So less noise and better cooling means more money or more wings
I got Insight G for 3500 during the sale(offline) . This thing has everything except the smart app control. Best VFM for that price.
Great.
Which is best among Atomberg Renesa, Atomberg Renesa Prime remote & Atomberg Renesa halloo? ( Non smart)
Kuhl Twist is a great fan. Supports all modern features.
6:42 you have missed out considering Havells Fab (available online) & Havells Epic (available offline). Both have similar specs which are better than the specs of the products you have listed /! recommended & available at under 3K price bracket
Thanks for sharing. Will look into why it got missed and check where it falls in my recommendations. On first look, it does look equivalent to the ones recommended.
Good..pls do video on table fan as well..
what about super fan x1 model
What if the remote stops working ? Is there any option to control the fan speed with the regulator?can we switch it on using the regular switches?

One Star – Extremely Disappointed with After-Sale Service

I rarely write reviews, but the after-sale service for this ceiling fan has been beyond frustrating. The fan itself worked fine for about a month, and then it started making a loud clicking noise. I contacted customer support, and that’s where the real nightmare began.

It took over a week just to get a response, and even then, it was a generic reply asking for details I had already provided. After multiple follow-ups, they finally agreed to send a technician—who never showed up. Rescheduled three times, and each time they either didn’t show up or cancelled last minute with no explanation.

It’s been nearly two months now, and the issue is still unresolved. I’ve wasted time, energy, and money on something that should’ve been a simple fix. Terrible customer service, no accountability, and zero urgency. I would NOT recommend this brand to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.

Hopefully will pay off in long run
Hopefully it should last that long as  mouth shut is filled with complaints of atomberg and other brands are 20-30 percent more cheaper
Uske bat to free hai na ?
And fan will work 4-5 months after that every month you will a new problem 😂😂
Wobbles and makes lot of sound. Worse than 1000 rupees local fan.  This fan is just a marketing gimmick. Cashing on we Indians weakness of ""made in India"" and saving money.
Good fan iam use 2 years
Kya apke fan me hilne ka problem hai?

Their speed is slow compared to three blade fans
Indian populace who haven't used bldc fans still think HIGH RPM means High air delivery. It's not. High RPM only causes High Noise and low air delivery while consuming more power. A good modern fan should consume less power and Deliver MORE AIR DOWNWARD WITH LESS RPM this having low noise and smooth breeze like air throughout the room. These fans deliver that much air with much less RPM hence they are great to have. 
This more blade fans are for cold environment is a false thought that most Indians who haven't used such a appliance think but once they experience it they understand why it's better and why it's SO EXPENSIVE. 
The price is it's only downside.
@@debdulalsenapati1391 either you have not used multi blade fan or you have very low ceiling small room.
@@vishalpratap6991 I have not used 8 blade BLDC fan yet but have used 6 blade one in a Regular 14*13 room and the air throughput of a 6 blade dc fan is quite good along with another 4 blade BLDC fan I use. I feel both provide almost equal air delivery but the 6 blade one does it in lower RPM. That's my observation of it. 
Theoretically and as Written on the specs a 8 blade fan will provide similar air delivery at  a Slightly lower or equal as 6 blade air delivery. That's what I think it will be judging by the 6 blade performance but I feel a 6 blade fan is enough in place of 8 blade. 

The goal is to run the fan in lower RPM and get a nice Air Circulation Breeze instead of having High RPM Noise and irregular hot n cold air circulation in the Room.  

Do tell about  your Experience of any higher blade fan experience.

Electricity bill se hi spare parts ke cost save ho gaye 😂
Thanks for the very detailed comparison!!
Bldc fan has many electronic components.  So its life expectancy is very short. It ie also very expensive to repair.
It has a simple rectifier circuit with built in surge protection and a speed controller. 

Nothing rocket science. 
Life expectancy is as long as you don’t get extreme surge currents (which in case of a normal fan generally burns the copper windings which is more expensive than repairing the rectifier circuit of a BLDC.
Hats off bro.. Very nice
Lovely explanation. Sweet & simple.
Very good comparison... Thanks...
Very informative content, dint expect such measurements from an Indian channel, good work bro.. But whats with your posture? Keep calm, it's almost like youre dancing...

Hey thanks for making such informational videos.
Can you please make a video on how do we check our power voltage at our home.
Also I wanted to know if there is any products where we can check the voltage
Thanks for your feedback!
For remote control need cells bro add that cost also in BLDC fan

Lol, I'm using BLDC Fan since 2 years, Still the battery going on.
Vry nice vdo..
Best explanation
good information shared bro
Quality content
Why mentioned in bldc ceiling fan battery powered 
It's Ac to Dc to convert or what ?
what's the difference in higher voltage or uf of a replacement capacitor for ceiling fan?? English please!
It doesn't matter if i have already invested in household Solar energy and also more components and more maintainance of bldc fans is expensive......just get solar and get cost effective for everything else
Top most issue of rpm of fan..you didn't explained........whyy...?
Repairing cost of bldc ? How often they need servicing

3 महीने में पंखा चलते चलते कभी भी बंद हो जाता कभी भी चल पड़ता । इसकी पीसीबी change krwani padi warranty में थी तो फ्री में हो गई, नहीं तो 1500 रुपए फसाते रहो। आगे का पता नहीं कब तक चले🥲। इससे अच्छा तो बिना bldc वाला पंखा है, 10 साल से चला रहा हूं, टेंशन फ्री तो हूं बाबा।

Hindi me video banaya karo yaar

What about BLDC Vs Normal fan reparing cost ?
I think not more then 7k, so don't worry and go for BLDC
I got normal fan for 1800, and power consumption is 42w

So I went with it than a BLDC fan
Does BLDC fans Have Humming Sound in Low Speed Like Normal Fans with regulators ??
No.. koi sound nahi aata kisi bhi speed par.

Bro don't fool people. At cost of 1700 we csn get a normal fan with 56 watt energy consumption conpated to 32 watt BLDC fan. So it's expensive that too in long term as the money in my bank will also increase. BLDC is good but not the replacement for fans
How about service?
Will local electricians be able to repair the bldc fans?

Ae bhai abhi normal yaani Induction Motor wale fans ki wattage kam ho chuki hai karib 50-60W tak hi rehta hai 80W nahi brother. Please correct yourself.

Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can't hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me
Kya kehna chahte ho bhai?😂
Color konsa hai?
Please please do not buy bldc fan.
Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai. Jo 20 sal tak bhi chal jata hai..  phir bldc jhatu lene ka kya fayda..???

Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long.

Atomberg Renesa smart and Atomberg Renesa smart plus ye dono ke andar kuch khaas difference nahi hain..., sirf Renesa smart plus ka blade ka design thoda alag hain.
                     Application support dono ka same hain koi difference nahi hain. ""Atomberg Home"" app se dono connect hota hain.

Thanks for your comment.

Atomberg renesa
This model is ""atomberg renesa smart"".
Kon se app se chala rhe ho bro?
""Atomberg home"" app se bro.

wahh... 🙂 , aap ye fan kitne time se use kar rahe ho ?
Is it possible to control speed of renesa smart through alexa? Like - ""alexa set fan speed 4""
Yes, it is possible.

Yes, you are right!
This is atomberg renesa smart BLDC ceiling fan.
But fan speed is very low
The speed of the fan will increase a lot after using it for a few days.
It is normal for a new fan to have low speed.

How is this fan, is this still in good condition?
Yes!
But there are few things you should know..., 
I am using two atomberg bldc fans... first one is 2.2 years old (atomberg renesa) and second one is 1.5 years old (atomberg renesa smart). Both fans are running absolutely fine in my case..., but my cousine is using renesa and facing PCB speed control issues from the beginning. 
                                   As per my knowledge, If you purchase it from a trusted and reliable shopping platform so you are less likely to get future issues.

Yay, I’ve been waiting for this one. The best and clearest explanation for getting my fan into my smart home. Thanks Shane, as always.
Glad it was helpful. Thanks for watching!
I use Bond + Homebridge+bond plugin. I have 1 DC and 5 AC fans, using the inbox RF controllers and remotes, and all work as expected including speed control and (usually) light dimmer. You program the Bond using the existing remotes and can do some customizing using their app. It's very simple to then connect the Bond to HomeKit and it's been working great. Occasionally requires cycling the bond unit and/or homebridge, but not often.

None of my fans are controlled by a wall switch, but if they were, I would use a smart switch, wire the load to the hot at the junction box, and use automations. I also have the Bond connected to my RF (cheap, but not smart) shades. So, currently nine devices all controlled by a $100 hub + my existing homebridge. No need to get up on ladders, ;)
You can apparently use Starling Home Hub to bring those ceiling fans into your Apple Home since it now supports Works With Google devices. I just ordered mine and will hopefully be able to add my Bond devices to my Apple Home this way. I know Bond Bridge has also added direct Apple Home integration but as of now a lot of devices aren't supported including ceiling fans.
@@MajorPickleSwag Did you end up getting Starling Home Hub to bring your Bond fans into Apple Home? I am looking into the same thing.
Thanks, needed this info for my new build. Almost bought the Lutron fan control for a dc fan.
You need to be extremely sure that your switch is rated for fan control - also called an inductive load. Motors have an extremely high inrush current (a massive but temporary spike in wattage as it begins to spin).
Damn son!  Way to land the Best Buy sponsorship 😀
my boy is laying down the law and taking names son
I've been using a smart switch with Smartthings for fan controls. I still have to get the ladder out twice a year to change the direction though.   Clockwise in the winter, counter-clockwise in the summer....other than that, the switches have worked out great. I can tell Alexa to turn on or off my fans also if I don't feel like getting up.
1 year later and still no one has come up with an attractive universal DC fan controller for existing 3 Wire. DC fans offer superior efficiency and smaller motors. Kasa came up with another 5 wire AC fan smart switch, single din, lovely looking, dimmable for light and fan, which is great, but doesn't address the issue. If someone came up with a nice looking, smart, dimmable for light and fan, single gang switch with a universal DC fan controller, they would kill it.   I've looked all over, nothing. Minka fans offer the last offensive and smart wall option, which I've used on my 3 wire rooms. Since most of their DC fans are wifi, you still get smarts compatibility.  If you don't care about a wall switch, most DC fans now are smart compatible.
100%. Actually we are now 2 years put
Shane, great explanation & caution with the newer dc powered fan motors. I use a Bond controller that operates all my fans throughout my home. Works great with RF or infrared operated fans that work of that style remote. Makes dumb fans & other devices smart!
I love that I can control my house's many fans with my Bond controller.  It rocks!  It's incredibly frustrating (understandable, but frustrating) that it can't track fan state, however, so if you ever use the remote to adjust something, usually the Bond has no idea anything has changed.  Especially bad if the lights and fan are turned on or off for something that only has a state toggle... so now that light is on, and when your automation (or Siri) tries to ""turn on the lights in x room"", it instead toggles the fan light OFF and the rest of the lights come on...
We just purchased 4 RF controlled ceiling fans with light and your video makes a lot of sense using the Aqara relays for all of them. I’m taking it a step further by using a Tuya RF blaster and homebridge to control the fan speed in HK. But now I’m wondering if i should only use the Tuya RF blaster.
My existing fan had a RF based switch - ended up putting a smart bulb in, and bond RF Controller through homebridge to get the fan into homekit. Works great.
Thanks for sharing! Do you not have a light switch? Or just don’t use it?
Same for me. I use a Broadcom RF and IR controller and learned in the several speed settings from the remote and the light. I don’t use a wallswitch (that’s always on).
Hey Shane. coming from the Z wave (honestly possible with zigbee as well) world there's a great way to achieve what you want with the ""accidentally killing the light switch"" issue for those who want to use a relay or smart controller but still want to keep it WAF certified. for switches like Zooz and Inovelli that offer scene control. you can disable the internal relay so that physical button presses don't kill the power. this way you can press the top or bottom of the switch physically and tie those actions to the on/off respectively of the fan and/or light. it's a great alternative to keeping the house as user friendly as possible. plus in the event of say a power outage or something odd where you need to enable the physical relay for whatever reason, you can do this manually at the switch with no network communication required, just a series of button presses.
I wish I could find the fan relays you mentioned.  Would buy in a heartbeat as long as it's locally controlled!  thanks for the info!
What about a pull cord ceiling fan that has the cords for the fan and the light, that’s powered by a single rocker switch?
You should get some sort of basic electrician certificate with all the electrical work you do.

And thank you, this was a very much needed video. Been struggling with what to do about a lot of my fans.

Want to do the Meross switch, but not sure what to do with the empty spot it will leave. Would love a hardwired scene button. Looked like one of the switches you showed had scene buttons on it. Would love more on that switch. 🙃
I used my BroadLink universal remote to send a signal to my remote control fan with HOOBs. Works perfect.
Another option is to pair a smart button with the smart fans -- I set those for on/off so there is still a ""switch"" in the bedroom
Yes, that's a great suggestion, especially if you don't have a switch or have to wire one to be always hot.
Great point!
Great video. You answered so many questions i had, and many questions I didn’t have but now do!
I'm using the Sonoff iFan04 which I flashed with HAA which enables native homekit support (no bridge etc needed). 3 fan speeds + can use a remote if wanted
best option for AC fans
Hi, how do you flash the Sonoff? I think this is the route I need to take
Hunter integrates their receivers into the motor unit now, and can’t be bypassed without significant modification, at least on all the models I looked at. Hopefully they’ll be companies that still make nice “dumb” fans for a while. Went with Harbor Breeze for my 2 recent installs so I could use Lutron switches.
Thanks for the comment. So Harbor Breeze allows you to use Lutron Switches?
@@Doriginal5 Yes, most of their fans are just regular “dumb fans” that have a pull chain.
For those few people who have ceiling fans that use RF remotes, a great option is the ""Bond Bridge"" which is basically an RF (and IR) transmitter that can learn and transmit any codes, and it has native homekit support. Using this device I was able to integrate all of the ceiling fans in my house with Homekit, including speed and directional control, automations etc. The only downside is as you mention if physical switch is turned off. I live alone so not a problem with me, but if you have kids or frequent guests etc, you can always wire the switch so it's always hot, or use your trick of replacing the switch with a wireless rocker etc.
when you say bond bridge has native homekit support, does that mean you don't need home assistant or other bridge to get it to work with homekit?
@@jessicaanastasio39 I have the older one that I use HomeBridge/hoobs to integrate with homekit, but the pro beta firmware (that I have not yet tried) has native homekit support.
@@jessicaanastasio39 Correct!
@@compudude This is from Bond Bridge's support page: ""HomeKit for shade control using a Bond Bridge Pro on firmware 3.8.4 is available with Bond Home application version 2.43.0.  HomeKit does not offer a preset position option so you will not be able to use that feature through HomeKit. 
Note: Support for ceiling fans, fireplaces, and other devices are not yet available with HomeKit.""

From this, I conclude that Bond Bridge Pro offers limited HomeKit support, but it does not currently support ceiling fans. Am I missing something?
@@davidwalser462 I'm using a non-Pro Bond, and control my RF ceiling fans with HomeKit.  I may be using either HomeBridge or HomeAssistant to pass through the commands, though... I honestly can't really recall.  I can control lights and fan speed, however.  It's stateless, though, and toggling light state is the best it can do, so sometimes things get out of sync and something has to be manually changed with the OEM remote to get it back to normal.
Good video Turning fans on and off from an app seems pretty easy. However, controlling the fan's speed seems a little vague. For example, if you wanted to automate the fan's speed dependent on heat or humidity sensors?
10:52 A relatively simple solution here that I’m kinda surprised you didn’t mention is smart bulbs. Especially if you have ones that can be paired to a smart button like Philips Hue with the Lutron Aurora. Definitely isn’t cheap but works incredibly well if you don’t care about controlling the fan through HomeKit.
the reason he didn’t mention it is because this video is about making your ceiling fans smart. smart bulbs can easily lose power and become non responsive once someone flips the switch by accident. the same goes for ceiling fans. that is why he dives deep into smart switches and other options. the end goal is to have smart control over these things without worrying about power being cut off at the switch.
@@jaykea True, although if you wire the light switch to be always on (or physically manage switch access with a cover), then you can control that bulb via Smart switches instead.
I use Caseta...it works great
Well said
Hey Shane for the outdoor smart fan, (hub space) I add to home bridge and works good
Well done...   Thanks!
Really looking to see what will happen now that Matter supports FANs!
11:20 this scenario is so funny to me lol. i can almost see this being useful with alexa, but then I remember how often i change my fan speed..maybe I would adjust it seasonally..maybe.
I had no idea I could bypass the remote hub thing. I lost one of my remotes for about a month and we were stuck
Yeah I'm interested in this and would love to have some matter supported smart fans. You can probably wire up a dumb fan and that's probably best but it would be nice to have more to control than just on or off
Hey, very nice video! I am planning to buy a hunter fan with wall control, would the lutron caseta smart control work?
My family room fan is a DC unit with a single wall switch and remote control. I replaced the wall switch with a smart switch to automate it turning on and off, then use the remote if I need to change the settings on the fan, which doesn't happen much.

Alexa can turn the fan on and off, and I programmed it to come on or off 5 minutes after my gas fireplace does either.

My 3 guest bedrooms have standard AC / dual switches with pull chains.  I haven't decided whether to attach those to smart switches.  Maybe if I put Echo devices in the rooms. But then each guest bedroom would need distinct names for each fan switch.

Edit: Someone above suggested buttons which are a great substitute for the Alexa smart speakers. THIS is what I'll put on the night stands in the guest rooms.

-So complicated for something that seems so simple!
Your DC fans- if the power is interrupted or turned off w the wall switch, do they return to the last speed setting and ""on"" when the switch it turned back on? Or power comes back?  My DC fans do not; if they were running and I flip the wall switch they just turn off and I need to use the remote to select fan speed to turn on again. Very frustrating!
@@bjjere Yes. I have 3 such fans. They all turn on and off with the wall switch, of which only one is smart.  They stay programmed as per their last remote control settings.

All I benefit from is the on/off feature with the smart switch.
Love when you do a deep dive into something like this. If you happen to have any friends with reverse cycle split system air conditioners (I think you call them mini splits?) I'd love to see that! Mine are driving me completely batty. Automations through the Aqara app managed the temperature fairly well, but made the air conditioner beep every couple of minutes. Switchbot didn't give me enough control on dehumidify. Now I'm trying to use the temperature sensors in the HomePod minis with scenes exported from Aqara. It's currently 53F in here and it's cooling 🙄 I'm about ready to pull my hair out!
I use the Cielo Plus units on my Mini Split AC/Heatpumps.  It controls them very well but they don't integrate into smart home yet...
Yeah, this is a huge problem for me. There is one fan / light combo in the house wired to one wall switch. All the other rooms have separate switches for the light and the fan. The single switch is a due to a lack of design thoughtfulness on the part of the builder. I use Lutron Caseta throughout the house and just considering a standalone solution to that one fan is grating to me. I’m glad, due to your due diligence, that I do understand the problem and that the lack of a straightforward solution is not unique to me. I really do not want to extend the gang box and run new wire. I have ideas for a product that would work but, wow, what a First World problem….
yea it's a frustrating thing to encounter. with an AC fan and both loads at the switch it's an easy fix, but if you only have 1 load then best bet is a smart fan controller or relay in the fan canopy, then you can leverage a dual button or scene based switch to make it as user friendly as possible. so you can make it so that the load can never bee accidentally turned off, but the light switch buttons can still serve as on/off.
Agree!    He starts out saying, ""My house has it (on 5 of 6 rooms), so I assume it's standard.""   I'll go out on a limb and say NO.  I had a new construction house built 10 years ago, and had to pay extra to get two switches (and a fan-rated ceiling box).  But every other house I've seen, it's a single ceiling switch.
Have you looked into the Bond Bridge? If your ceiling fan has a remote you can program each button into HomeKit using the bridge
Yes, I've heard mixed reviews about Bond Bridge. Some folks love it. It does still require homebridge though. And that still doesn't allow you to use wired wall switches, which is something I tried to address.
Have you checked out WAC Fans they have a remote that looks like Lutron and they also have a wall switch that gives power without neutral wire and communicates with the fan without remote but you still can use the remote as well
Also it hooks up with SmartThings and Alexa and google but no HomeKit
Love the channel watching all the vids as moving into a new home. We are going with Apple home for our smart controller.  Rooms have individual switches for fan and light pre wired. We want smart fans but also need a remote/controller etc at the bedside. You mention NOT to buy smart fans (we were going to buy Hunter fans with Apple home capability). What do you recommend instead?
do you have a diagram for single switch using aqara relay?
Great video, are there any relays that work in DC fans that allow speed control of the fans?  AC fans?  Thanks
4:24 Hey switches are these at the 4:24 mark
Hi there Shane. Great video I am now rewatching as I am preparing to install more smart switches for fans. My situation is having a single AC wall switch that I keep turned on and I control my fan and light using its RF remote. When I originally watched this, i bought and (had) installed the Meross Wifi Smart Switch. Since then, I have adopted Lutron (again via your great recommendation). 

Given this video was made in 2023, I am wondering if there are any other solutions other than Meross. I have really struggled with their garage opener (I know you recommended the other one but I bought the Meross before subscribing to your channel and now becoming a member) . Thanks in advance.
Thanks for watching. I don't think there are any new solutions for your situation that I'm aware of. If you have a single switch that controls both the fan and the light, you are limited if you want to separate them for separate ""smart"" controls.  You will likely have to separate the fan and light using some sort of relay in the fan canopy. I've used Aqara's relay. I've heard of some others, maybe there is one now that will also provide fan speed control, but I have not used them.
with the switch issue you have, can you use Bond? that hub that makes the fan smart and add all the controls? and then the Bond hub can connect with the smart switch and now you got best of both worlds?
Can you do a video on how to add RF Fans to Apple Home
We have separate fan, speed control and a separate light on/off control.

For a DC fan can I just eliminate the fan control wall switch and hook everything up to the light on/off switch.

This way I can just control the fan speed and light light brightness using the fans remote control?
what a great summary! a random question, what's your automation for fan during these cool and winter time?
Thanks for watching! Mainly I use the ceiling fans in automations that say: when the temperature in a room gets above XXº, turn the fan on.
@@ShaneCreates Thanks. However, the fan does not decrease the temperature so it would run forever. It can reduce the ""feels like temperature"" but not the actual temperature.
I have an A/C fan, 2-gang box with separate fan control (multi-speed) and lights (the fan doesn't have a light kit built in). I use apple homekit. What do you recommend for fan speed control? The Meross and Lutron seem to only make fan speed speed control combined with light control.
What if you doing have a fan in a room at all (just a ceiling light) but want to install a smart fan?
Shane, 

Love your videos, I’ve been watching you for a long time and you’ve helped me build my smart home! 

I’m about to go through a reno in my condo and I’m installing Hunter Aerodyne smart fans, I have single gang dumb switch where 1 switch controls both the light and the fan (originally there was no fan, it was just a light). I’ve watched a number of your videos on ceiling fans and smart switches and I’m still kind of confused what to do. 

I feel like a simple Lutron caseta diva dimmer switch could be the answer. It will control the light and prevent power from being cut to the light/fan. I will have full control of the light and fan via HomeKit/Siri and the Hunter app, so I don’t really need the switch to control them both. But I want a smart switch to prevent the power being cut to the device. 

What are your thoughts? 

Hope to hear back.

Paul!
Hey Paul thanks for watching. Most smart switches will still cut the power the switch is turned off, unless you get a smart switch that has a ""smart bulb mode"" or ""relay lock."" Lutron does not. There are a few that can do this, like Inovelli or the new Aqara switches. The two button Aqara switch might be a good option if you have an Aqara Hub, or don't mind getting one. You could wire the switch but lock the relay in the Aqara app, so the physical switch doesn't actually cut the power to the fan/light. You could then create automations for each button to toggle the fan and light on/off separately in the Apple Home app.
@@ShaneCreatesthanks for getting back to me, I was originally thinking the white series switches from Inovelli (which I will be using in my bathroom). Maybe I’ll just get those, but I’ll look into the Aqara option as well as I do have a couple Aqara hubs throughout the condo already as well.
Me: ""I installed smart bulb so you can ask Siri to turn on or off the light. We just have to keep the wall switch on all the time and only use homekit or ask siri.""

Yay, I’ve been waiting for this one. The best and clearest explanation for getting my fan into my smart home. Thanks Shane, as always.
Glad it was helpful. Thanks for watching!
I use Bond + Homebridge+bond plugin. I have 1 DC and 5 AC fans, using the inbox RF controllers and remotes, and all work as expected including speed control and (usually) light dimmer. You program the Bond using the existing remotes and can do some customizing using their app. It's very simple to then connect the Bond to HomeKit and it's been working great. Occasionally requires cycling the bond unit and/or homebridge, but not often.

None of my fans are controlled by a wall switch, but if they were, I would use a smart switch, wire the load to the hot at the junction box, and use automations. I also have the Bond connected to my RF (cheap, but not smart) shades. So, currently nine devices all controlled by a $100 hub + my existing homebridge. No need to get up on ladders, ;)
You can apparently use Starling Home Hub to bring those ceiling fans into your Apple Home since it now supports Works With Google devices. I just ordered mine and will hopefully be able to add my Bond devices to my Apple Home this way. I know Bond Bridge has also added direct Apple Home integration but as of now a lot of devices aren't supported including ceiling fans.
@@MajorPickleSwag Did you end up getting Starling Home Hub to bring your Bond fans into Apple Home? I am looking into the same thing.
Thanks, needed this info for my new build. Almost bought the Lutron fan control for a dc fan.
You need to be extremely sure that your switch is rated for fan control - also called an inductive load. Motors have an extremely high inrush current (a massive but temporary spike in wattage as it begins to spin).
Damn son!  Way to land the Best Buy sponsorship 😀
my boy is laying down the law and taking names son
I've been using a smart switch with Smartthings for fan controls. I still have to get the ladder out twice a year to change the direction though.   Clockwise in the winter, counter-clockwise in the summer....other than that, the switches have worked out great. I can tell Alexa to turn on or off my fans also if I don't feel like getting up.
1 year later and still no one has come up with an attractive universal DC fan controller for existing 3 Wire. DC fans offer superior efficiency and smaller motors. Kasa came up with another 5 wire AC fan smart switch, single din, lovely looking, dimmable for light and fan, which is great, but doesn't address the issue. If someone came up with a nice looking, smart, dimmable for light and fan, single gang switch with a universal DC fan controller, they would kill it.   I've looked all over, nothing. Minka fans offer the last offensive and smart wall option, which I've used on my 3 wire rooms. Since most of their DC fans are wifi, you still get smarts compatibility.  If you don't care about a wall switch, most DC fans now are smart compatible.
100%. Actually we are now 2 years put
Shane, great explanation & caution with the newer dc powered fan motors. I use a Bond controller that operates all my fans throughout my home. Works great with RF or infrared operated fans that work of that style remote. Makes dumb fans & other devices smart!
I love that I can control my house's many fans with my Bond controller.  It rocks!  It's incredibly frustrating (understandable, but frustrating) that it can't track fan state, however, so if you ever use the remote to adjust something, usually the Bond has no idea anything has changed.  Especially bad if the lights and fan are turned on or off for something that only has a state toggle... so now that light is on, and when your automation (or Siri) tries to ""turn on the lights in x room"", it instead toggles the fan light OFF and the rest of the lights come on...
We just purchased 4 RF controlled ceiling fans with light and your video makes a lot of sense using the Aqara relays for all of them. I’m taking it a step further by using a Tuya RF blaster and homebridge to control the fan speed in HK. But now I’m wondering if i should only use the Tuya RF blaster.
My existing fan had a RF based switch - ended up putting a smart bulb in, and bond RF Controller through homebridge to get the fan into homekit. Works great.
Thanks for sharing! Do you not have a light switch? Or just don’t use it?
Same for me. I use a Broadcom RF and IR controller and learned in the several speed settings from the remote and the light. I don’t use a wallswitch (that’s always on).
Hey Shane. coming from the Z wave (honestly possible with zigbee as well) world there's a great way to achieve what you want with the ""accidentally killing the light switch"" issue for those who want to use a relay or smart controller but still want to keep it WAF certified. for switches like Zooz and Inovelli that offer scene control. you can disable the internal relay so that physical button presses don't kill the power. this way you can press the top or bottom of the switch physically and tie those actions to the on/off respectively of the fan and/or light. it's a great alternative to keeping the house as user friendly as possible. plus in the event of say a power outage or something odd where you need to enable the physical relay for whatever reason, you can do this manually at the switch with no network communication required, just a series of button presses.
I wish I could find the fan relays you mentioned.  Would buy in a heartbeat as long as it's locally controlled!  thanks for the info!
What about a pull cord ceiling fan that has the cords for the fan and the light, that’s powered by a single rocker switch?
You should get some sort of basic electrician certificate with all the electrical work you do.

And thank you, this was a very much needed video. Been struggling with what to do about a lot of my fans.

Want to do the Meross switch, but not sure what to do with the empty spot it will leave. Would love a hardwired scene button. Looked like one of the switches you showed had scene buttons on it. Would love more on that switch. 🙃
I used my BroadLink universal remote to send a signal to my remote control fan with HOOBs. Works perfect.
Another option is to pair a smart button with the smart fans -- I set those for on/off so there is still a ""switch"" in the bedroom
Yes, that's a great suggestion, especially if you don't have a switch or have to wire one to be always hot.
Great point!
Great video. You answered so many questions i had, and many questions I didn’t have but now do!
I'm using the Sonoff iFan04 which I flashed with HAA which enables native homekit support (no bridge etc needed). 3 fan speeds + can use a remote if wanted
best option for AC fans
Hi, how do you flash the Sonoff? I think this is the route I need to take
Hunter integrates their receivers into the motor unit now, and can’t be bypassed without significant modification, at least on all the models I looked at. Hopefully they’ll be companies that still make nice “dumb” fans for a while. Went with Harbor Breeze for my 2 recent installs so I could use Lutron switches.
Thanks for the comment. So Harbor Breeze allows you to use Lutron Switches?
@@Doriginal5 Yes, most of their fans are just regular “dumb fans” that have a pull chain.
For those few people who have ceiling fans that use RF remotes, a great option is the ""Bond Bridge"" which is basically an RF (and IR) transmitter that can learn and transmit any codes, and it has native homekit support. Using this device I was able to integrate all of the ceiling fans in my house with Homekit, including speed and directional control, automations etc. The only downside is as you mention if physical switch is turned off. I live alone so not a problem with me, but if you have kids or frequent guests etc, you can always wire the switch so it's always hot, or use your trick of replacing the switch with a wireless rocker etc.
when you say bond bridge has native homekit support, does that mean you don't need home assistant or other bridge to get it to work with homekit?
@@jessicaanastasio39 I have the older one that I use HomeBridge/hoobs to integrate with homekit, but the pro beta firmware (that I have not yet tried) has native homekit support.
@@jessicaanastasio39 Correct!
@@compudude This is from Bond Bridge's support page: ""HomeKit for shade control using a Bond Bridge Pro on firmware 3.8.4 is available with Bond Home application version 2.43.0.  HomeKit does not offer a preset position option so you will not be able to use that feature through HomeKit. 
Note: Support for ceiling fans, fireplaces, and other devices are not yet available with HomeKit.""

From this, I conclude that Bond Bridge Pro offers limited HomeKit support, but it does not currently support ceiling fans. Am I missing something?
@@davidwalser462 I'm using a non-Pro Bond, and control my RF ceiling fans with HomeKit.  I may be using either HomeBridge or HomeAssistant to pass through the commands, though... I honestly can't really recall.  I can control lights and fan speed, however.  It's stateless, though, and toggling light state is the best it can do, so sometimes things get out of sync and something has to be manually changed with the OEM remote to get it back to normal.
Good video Turning fans on and off from an app seems pretty easy. However, controlling the fan's speed seems a little vague. For example, if you wanted to automate the fan's speed dependent on heat or humidity sensors?
10:52 A relatively simple solution here that I’m kinda surprised you didn’t mention is smart bulbs. Especially if you have ones that can be paired to a smart button like Philips Hue with the Lutron Aurora.

Hey Paul thanks for watching. Most smart switches will still cut the power the switch is turned off, unless you get a smart switch that has a ""smart bulb mode"" or ""relay lock."" Lutron does not. There are a few that can do this, like Inovelli or the new Aqara switches. The two button Aqara switch might be a good option if you have an Aqara Hub, or don't mind getting one. You could wire the switch but lock the relay in the Aqara app, so the physical switch doesn't actually cut the power to the fan/light. You could then create automations for each button to toggle the fan and light on/off separately in the Apple Home app.

Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can't hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me

Please please do not buy bldc fan.
Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai.

Atomberg Renesa Smart, it is a brand new model. You can buy this from ""amazon"", don't buy this from flipkart..., because flipkart is sending faulty and refurbised product now a days... and they do not even approve return request!

Tap hi karna hai tu ek remote jaisa smartphone UI dete atomberg voice assistant mean just use voice
ha sahi bola aapne..., sirf smart wale fans me alexa and google assistant voice command ka option hain.
I have the same model but there are no voice command options in my app. Are you using Alexa with it?
Good

atomberg renesa smart vs renesa smart plus kya difference hai application support ka ya or kuch

                     Application support dono ka same hain koi difference nahi hain. ""Atomberg Home"" app se dono connect hota hain.

Kon se app se chala rhe ho bro?
""Atomberg home"" app se bro.
Bhai ye mere ghar me hai fan google assistant se control ho jata hai

Is it possible to control speed of renesa smart through alexa? Like - ""alexa set fan speed 4""
Yes, it is possible.
Please note- ""Atomberg home"" app is little slow and it takes time to configure the entire process.

Nahi brother..., atomberg renesa ko google assistant or alexa se control karna possible nahi hain!
                                           only IR(Infra Red) enabled mobile se control kar sakte ho aap.

Yes bro. kar sakte ho... koi dikkat nahi, but same to same mat daal dena, apna effort daalna bohot zaroori hota hain bro...., like- voice over, collab etc.
@AmazingTechniqueGyan  Reply Bro
@AmazingTechniqueGyan  bro bas tumhe mujhe apna video bhej dena jisse edit karna hai  aur apna voice ok
How is this fan, is this still in good condition?
Yes!
But there are few things you should know..., 
I am using two atomberg bldc fans... first one is 2.2 years old (atomberg renesa) and second one is 1.5 years old (atomberg renesa smart). Both fans are running absolutely fine in my case..., but my cousine is using renesa and facing PCB speed control issues from the beginning. 
                                   As per my knowledge, If you purchase it from a trusted and reliable shopping platform so you are less likely to get future issues.

Thanks!

Tap hi karna hai tu ek remote jaisa smartphone UI dete atomberg voice assistant mean just use voice

atomberg renesa smart vs renesa smart plus kya difference hai application support ka ya or kuch
Atomberg Renesa smart and Atomberg Renesa smart plus ye dono ke andar kuch khaas difference nahi hain..., sirf Renesa smart plus ka blade ka design thoda alag hain.
                     Application support dono ka same hain koi difference nahi hain. ""Atomberg Home"" app se dono connect hota hain.

Is it possible to control speed of renesa smart through alexa? Like - ""alexa set fan speed 4""
Yes, it is possible.
Please note- ""Atomberg home"" app is little slow and it takes time to configure the entire process.

Sayd mobile connection nahi hai rensa prime me
""Renesa prime"" and ""Renesa prime remote"" dono ceiling fan me mobile(wifi/bluetooth) connectivity feature available nahi hain. 
                                                              But ""renesa prime remote"" wale model ko apne mobile phone ka IR(infra red) remote se connecct karke operate kar sakte hain.
Ji haa, mobile connection(bluetooth or wifi) feature available nahi hain.
This is atomberg Renesa smart
Yes, you are right!
This is atomberg renesa smart BLDC ceiling fan.
But fan speed is very low
The speed of the fan will increase a lot after using it for a few days.
It is normal for a new fan to have low speed.
Renesa plus have wifi or bluetooth facilities or not
""Renesa+"" don't have wifi or bluetooth feature.
""Renesa Smart+"" have the bluetooth and wifi feature.

Sorry to give you a DownVote for recommending Orient Aeroslim. I bought this fan and its not working from day one, there's 3 yrs Guarantee is USELESS since none would respond to you, I bought it from Amazon which clearly said No Warrnty...etc. I can use only 3 speed levels, no reverse flow or 4,5 speeds ever. In India warranty is only a number any body throws around - knowing well they won't honor. NEVER BUY ANY ORIENT FANS - THEY ARE SURE TO FAIL....
Thanks for sharing your experience!
Lagta hai Crompton se paise liye hai.... Crompton has many drawbacks .

Very boring
Hey Sumit ... which is the most silent and gives gentle air like a breeze, not like a fast blast.  Like fans in the old days.  Don't need remote and already have better lights in my room! :)   Thanks for being honest and straight, appreciated.  Tell me which model.
Can we operate bldc fan with normal regulator??
no
But in this fan noise more
its impossible
The motor noise is not important.  It's the noise of blades moving in the air that matters.  And by saying the performance is almost the same for all, then you have to work harder to find some product that you can recommend instead of just talking and talking.  And talking.

Hey Devanshu bhai, is this a sponsored/collab post, or a genuine review? 

If it's genuine, then you shouldn't put on such vague title and description, and at least mention that the product you're recommending it's 'not sponsored' in the video itself. 

And if it is sponsored, then I hope you know that you are legally required to clearly mention that too.

This is just a constructive feedback from my side. You are one of the few tech creators whom i genuinely trust, so please don't let us down.
Most likely a sponsor
It is a sponsored video , there is a includes paid promotion batch in the left bottom corner

Click here 👆for best ceiling fans https://amzn.to/4bMNptr
I'm using 3 atomberg fans (5 years old) and 2 super fan, atomberg had 3 warranty claims in first 3 years due to faulty / melted PCB on 2 fans which were used in living room and recently at its 5th year started bearing failure costing 1500 rupees per fan and this is when used for more than 12 hours a day but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer as the 3rd fan had no issues.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use I prefer a BLDC fan with longer warranty period , but the Atomberg brand service is definitely descent in Chennai.
⚠️ I'm using atomberg Fan for 1 year Renesa Smart ceiling fan 1200mm( wifi support) & Renesa Regular ceiling fan 1200mm😔, Don't Buy this both model👎, wifi & Remote control feature is great 👍 but no air flow, only in 5 speed & Boost mode you'll feel the air with fan rotating noise, Think before you buy, Don't fall in trap
Atomberg Less air flow with energy savings,
I bought 3 atomberg fan now i regret it , Do not buy atomberg fan the material of the body very chip within a year it broke after complain they change it , three year of use all of my fan having issue speed goes up and down .
Think twice before buy atomberg
Dont waste your money on atomberg there is other choice in the market
I've 4 Atomberg fans and they are working good. Speed is decent and blow is also good. I've Aris, and Renesa both are studio smart. Would recommend
Great, thanks for sharing!
Common problem is replacement waste. These companies should provide replacement discount and take back old. BLDC will penitrate more than someone want new fan for new flats😢

For the first time I felt that I have to click on the affiliate link in the video to buy a product. Very useful information. Thank you. Ordered atomberg via your link
Glad to be of help. 👍
6:13 Recently I bought this Activa Gracia fan, It has Reverse Mode.
This fan is very good. But not experienced about customer service till now
Thanks for sharing!
Hello Saumya, Namaskara! I’m in the middle of a home makeover and in a unique position where I need to buy a fan, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and mixie. I spent this weekend watching your videos, and I must say they are incredibly interesting! Your in-depth research really stands out, and it clearly reflects in the quality of your content. Thank you for all the effort you put in—it’s been extremely helpful!
Namaskara! So glad to hear that 💜
Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don’t have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn’t as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won’t necessarily save you money — because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.
Is this the case with all BLDC Fan Manufacturers? Does PCB go quite often? What is the approx replacement / service costs that you incur everytime?
@@Kumar-zx8mj no, it's not often. I have 2 old Atomberg Gorilla series ceiling fan and they are running fine without any problem for last 8 years. I'll suggest you to go for the basic models instead of premium models as, the basic models last longer.

In case your PCB gone then, if you find a good electronics engineer, he can fix that at much lower cost instead replacing the faulty PCB. Generally it has 2 part, one SMPS module to convert AC to DC and a driver unit to run the brush-less motor. I had to change the driver unit once for a Atomberg Renesa Ceiling fan and it cost me about 700-800 rupees. For another pedestal model as Atomberg did not provide support saying it is discontinued, I purchased one PCB from Amazon which costs me about 1000 rupees and, I was able to fix that fan with help of that.
Quality Content, Point to Point Explanation 
Thanks 👍
Great Explanation and Quality Content,
recommend fans for kitchen or small rooms ❤
Thunderstorm resistance is my main concern when considering a BLDC fan, due to frequent lightning in my area during monsoon🥲
I must shortlist as this is the best comparison video I have ever seen
Good video mam
Looks you have put lot of effort to do it🎉🎉
Really curious, as of where KHUL fans stand in the competition and why.. can you share YOUR view point? BTW you do a fantastic job here, enlightening our knowledge base 👏🙏
Your efforts& research behind such a video is  commendable
Hi!

Do you have any recommendation for bread makers with bread pans that are not teflon coated
Used superfan, atomberg and crompton. One of my Superfan has been running for the past 10 years on top of it has india made motor. Found Crompton to be a bit glitchy, speed drops randomly. Also have an atomberg exhaust fan but noticed it has a Chinese motor. I personally find BLDC fans to be a bit noisy especially at lower speeds. A big plus for bldc fans is the speed regulation,it is accurate and steady as compared to the usual regulators that fail in a few months.
Thank you so much for making it! ❤
Very useful ! Love your explanation and the research gone behind it.
TY SO MUCH.  UR VIDEOS R TO GOOD. I BOUGHT BOSCH INDUCTION HOB AND GAS HOB AFTER WATCHING UR VIDEOS !!!!! THANKS A TONNEE !. GONNA FINALISE FANS TOO !!
Very helpful,  especially for regions with power cuts and require battery back up
@TheGrapevineIndia Any recommendations for 1400 mm? Also if we want same design in 900mm,1200mm and 1400mm?
Helpful Thanks, So less noise and better cooling means more money or more wings
I got Insight G for 3500 during the sale(offline) . This thing has everything except the smart app control. Best VFM for that price.
Great.
Which is best among Atomberg Renesa, Atomberg Renesa Prime remote & Atomberg Renesa halloo? ( Non smart)
Kuhl Twist is a great fan. Supports all modern features.
6:42 you have missed out considering Havells Fab (available online) & Havells Epic (available offline). Both have similar specs which are better than the specs of the products you have listed /! recommended & available at under 3K price bracket
Thanks for sharing. Will look into why it got missed and check where it falls in my recommendations. On first look, it does look equivalent to the ones recommended.
Good..pls do video on table fan as well..
what about super fan x1 model
What if the remote stops working ? Is there any option to control the fan speed with the regulator?can we switch it on using the regular switches?
Some has a feature by switch clicking we can increase speed accordingly...
Mam how is  Anchor's Panasonic Rosalyn Dynamic 1200mm BLDC Ceiling Fan with Remote, 5 Star Ceiling Fan with 6 Speed Control Remote, High Speed Ceiling Fan, Glossy White, 3 Yrs Warranty which also looks asthethically very nice at around Rs.5300/- value for money in premium segment of BLDC fans ? How does it fare with your recommended premium fans can you plz tell what is the difference? Which one should one should one buy for hall I have 156 sq ft hall and budget around 5k to 6k.
Can you suggest some budget decorative fans for the living room.
Thanks a lot for all the research and suggestions.  Setting up a new home so would use your affiliate links for maximum purchase.  

1400mm sweep size fans have bad ratings across brands at Amazon. Would you recommend any in budget?
Upfront saving in 10 years. Do you think bldc fans that too in 2025 where profits > reliability will let you run anything till 10 years ?
Any bldc ceiling fan without Remote? Wil operate in regulator only?
What about fans with underlights? Is there any fan with an underlight that does not strobe? Please let us know.
How about superfan q series mam. It covers 260cmm with 270rpm . Is it good?
Best fan

Can you please recommend whether i should buy orient aerosense or atomberg aris starlight ? Both are of similar price and offer similar features the atomberg has high number number of reviews . Orient one doesn't have a lot of reviews . I am so confused... Lots of love❤❤

0:18 sounds like the speed capacitor in there is fine, but has the incorrect pullchain that has L-1, L-2, L-3 sequence. This is a common mistake where people rely on home center / big box stores to buy L-1, L-2, L-3 (Zing Ear 208S or 268S1) pullchains for triple-capacitor fans that require 2 speed capacitor values to combine for medium only to find out that the 2 and 3 terminals do NOT combine 2 values for medium. Being a triple capacitor fan requiring 2 speed capacitor values to combine for medium, he needs an L-1, L-2-3, L-3 (Zing Ear 268S6) pullchain where the 2 and 3 terminals on the Zing Ear 268S6 pullchains REQUIRES 2 speed capacitor values to combine for medium. Wiring diagram follows with the replacement Zing Ear 268S6 pullchain as:

L: black (power source wire for fan)
1: reverse switch wire (also branches from the common capacitor wire)
2: 7uf (higher speed capacitor value)
3: 5uf (lower speed capacitor value)",,7oAcaOZSVZ0,"Thats a great looking fan
0:18 sounds like the speed capacitor in there is fine, but has the incorrect pullchain that has L-1, L-2, L-3 sequence. This is a common mistake where people rely on home center / big box stores to buy L-1, L-2, L-3 (Zing Ear 208S or 268S1) pullchains for triple-capacitor fans that require 2 speed capacitor values to combine for medium only to find out that the 2 and 3 terminals do NOT combine 2 values for medium. Being a triple capacitor fan requiring 2 speed capacitor values to combine for medium, he needs an L-1, L-2-3, L-3 (Zing Ear 268S6) pullchain where the 2 and 3 terminals on the Zing Ear 268S6 pullchains REQUIRES 2 speed capacitor values to combine for medium.

Bhai atomberge ka renesa lu kya?
Renessa rpm low hai.. even at boost mode. Dusra koi problem nahi hai mene 3 sal ho gaye. Aap efficio hi lena vo bahut achha fan hai. Fast bhi ghumta hai.. mene design dekh kar renessa liya tha 5100rs ka. And 3400rs ka efficio liya tha.. Renessa dikhne me mast lagta hai par rpm low hai.
I'm using 5 year old 3 atomberg fans and 2 super fan, atomberg is giving bearing and PCB issues when used for more than 12 hours in Hall but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use areas buy a fan with longer warranty period
Bakwas he mat lena
Ayoo bro I am currently thinking of buying a hisense qled tv 43 inch to use as a Tv monitor can I use it and also ussi ko ghr wale kbhi kbhi tv bhi bana skte hai toh wo monitor kaam kar jaaiga na 120hz pr?
Atomberg ke fan 3 saal hi chalta he, kyoki ye chip me kaam karta he induction based nahi. Bldc bakwas he, 4000 ka fan kisi kam ka nahi, normal fan lo jo 1200ka ho

One Star – Extremely Disappointed with After-Sale Service

I rarely write reviews, but the after-sale service for this ceiling fan has been beyond frustrating. The fan itself worked fine for about a month, and then it started making a loud clicking noise. I contacted customer support, and that’s where the real nightmare began.

It took over a week just to get a response, and even then, it was a generic reply asking for details I had already provided. After multiple follow-ups, they finally agreed to send a technician—who never showed up. Rescheduled three times, and each time they either didn’t show up or cancelled last minute with no explanation.

It’s been nearly two months now, and the issue is still unresolved. I’ve wasted time, energy, and money on something that should’ve been a simple fix. Terrible customer service, no accountability, and zero urgency. I would NOT recommend this brand to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.

Bhai is type ke fans me sabse badi dikkat inke repairing me aati hai. Isme original repair possible nhi hota ya costly hota hai aur local wale technicians uska ready-made module laga ke de dete hai aur fir performance bilkul bekar ho jaata hai. Better ki aap Induction wale regular fan ko hi BLDC me convert kara le. Maximum 1200 se 1500 tak me ho jata hai. Uska bhi life iske jitna hi hota hai.

Does this fan wobble ?  because recently I saw some youtube videos mentioning this issue.
No. I bought it. 2years ago no issues..
Noise level ?
Noise boht hai ismein bakwas fan hai aur BLDC hone ke baad bhi normal fan ki tarah heat hota hai aur garam hawa phenkta hai kyonki iska PCB card andar band hai. Naam ki sadi hui LED lights hain bilkul dim, aur LED on karne par andar ka poori PCB plate dikhne lagti hai. Boht hi sada hua fab hai ye!

आपका फैन जब तक पूरी तरह से बंद न हो जाए तब तक कंपनी कुछ-भी नहीं करेगा.... आप जितने भी complaint क्यों ना दर्ज कर लो। आज से 4 साल पहले कंपनीने एकबार एक offer declare किया था की जिन जिन कस्टमरों ने कंपनी की website से EFFICIO model खरीदेगा उन सबको 4 साल की warranty मिलेगा l मैं एक retired person हूं, और electric-bill भी बहोत ज्यादा आरहा था। इसीलिए तब मैंने एक साथ 3 फैन खरीद लिया। लेकिन उसमें से एक फैन को पहले से ही 'speed variation' का problem था। और यह 'problem' हर summer को ही होते थे और मैं हर बार complaints दर्ज किया करता था। हर बार company की एक ही service engineer आया करता था और हर बार यह कहकर मामला को टाल देते थे की ""यह कोई problem नहीं है, कभी-कभी ऐसा होता है"".... जबकि यह clear था कि यह 👉 PBC-Motherboard का fault था !! और इस बार (4th & last year of warranty) भी जब मैंने complaint डाली, तब कंपनी की customer care से यह बोला गया कि ""आपका warranty 3 years की थी जो की अब खत्म हो चुकी है"" !!😞

Bhai is type ke fans me sabse badi dikkat inke repairing me aati hai. Isme original repair possible nhi hota ya costly hota hai aur local wale technicians uska ready-made module laga ke de dete hai aur fir performance bilkul bekar ho jaata hai. Better ki aap Induction wale regular fan ko hi BLDC me convert kara le. Maximum 1200 se 1500 tak me ho jata hai. Uska bhi life iske jitna hi hota hai.
Electricity consumption kesa hota unme
Near similar to ready available BLDC Fan. ​@@kingofkingsaahir8963

Does this fan wobble ?  because recently I saw some youtube videos mentioning this issue.
No. I bought it. 2years ago no issues..
Noise level ?
Noise boht hai ismein bakwas fan hai aur BLDC hone ke baad bhi normal fan ki tarah heat hota hai aur garam hawa phenkta hai kyonki iska PCB card andar band hai. Naam ki sadi hui LED lights hain bilkul dim, aur LED on karne par andar ka poori PCB plate dikhne lagti hai. Boht hi sada hua fab hai ye!

Is it possible to regulate speed through the existing regulator in the switch board. Please reply
No brother 
Only you can switch on ñ off with button 
Speed control is by remote only
Bro, my fan is running clock wise no wind downside, how can I make to anti clockwise how to do it?

Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long.

question 1- If I want to change the fan speed from 1 to 5.  direct change or gradual change (2->3>4>5) what should I do???
Questiin 2 - Does direct change affect  fans??? 
 Question  3 - A fan has initiated  a problem.  The fan speed automatically becomes up and down with irrespective  time gap. Customer support send a technician ,he observed and nothing errors has found. The technician says that is a voltage fluctuation but the other  rest of the atomberg fan speed  does not become ups and down at the same time.

what is the main reason??

Correct
Atomberg renesa ka yeh model behtreen tha jisme PCB uper lga rehta hai, New wala model ab bahut ghatiya hai purane wale se speed kam hai Air Flow bhi kam hai. Mujhe new model renesa ka bilkul pasand nhi aaaya, mere pass old model the lekin woh khatam ho gye the toh replacment mein mujhe new model mile meine old model ki bola toh bole ki ab discontinued ho chuke hain toh mein unhe use ker rha lekin purane wale ke compare mein yeh kuch bhi nhi 😔

Good work
Thank you
question 1- If I want to change the fan speed from 1 to 5.  direct change or gradual change (2->3>4>5) what should I do???
Questiin 2 - Does direct change affect  fans??? 
 Question  3 - A fan has initiated  a problem.  The fan speed automatically becomes up and down with irrespective  time gap. Customer support send a technician ,he observed and nothing errors has found. The technician says that is a voltage fluctuation but the other  rest of the atomberg fan speed  does not become ups and down at the same time.

what is the main reason??

Hi.  Do these fans fluctuate their speeds all time??  Mine are working like this.  Please suggest.
Speed variation issue
Follow steps
Run every speed 2 mins from

*)Booster (B) 2 mins
*)5th.  2 mins
*)4th.  2 mins
*)3th.  2 mins
*)2th.  2 mins
*)1th.   2 mins

And fan switch button off after check.
Do you bypass/cut the regulator connection from the board with fan. These fans won't work properly if you don't cut the regulator connection with the fan.

Hi.  Do these fans fluctuate their speeds all time??  Mine are working like this.  Please suggest.
Speed variation issue
Follow steps
Run every speed 2 mins from

*)Booster (B) 2 mins
*)5th.  2 mins
*)4th.  2 mins
*)3th.  2 mins
*)2th.  2 mins
*)1th.   2 mins

And fan switch button off after check.
Do you bypass/cut the regulator connection from the board with fan. These fans won't work properly if you don't cut the regulator connection with the fan.
OK thanks for making this video I m confuse purchase this fan.or not now I'm 100 % purchase 6 fan for my new home thanks bhai 

Sare comments karne wale bhai o ko bhi thanks

What is the difference between ikano and efficio alpha? Both of them look very similar and have similar features, but efficio alpha is   cheaper than ikano in their website and has only 2 years warranty.
I hv purchased 3 atomberg fans for new house. But I hv experienced that the speed is low compare to other competitors.
We expect for good air speed. ...agreed that we look for less power consumption but the speed results are not good.
I feel that better for normal fans as the speed is very low.
And atomberg should work to improve fan speed as well. Not happy but now I hv to use it . I can't spend anymore to replace atomberg.

Acha air flow hai 150sqft room tak ke liye laga sakte hai
@@PronixShortss ok sir thank u.
Remote pair nahi hota kya
Nahi uski need nhi
अन्दर से खट खट आवाज आता है
Kharab hone se local mechanic thik kar payenge
Common problem inme PCB ya magnet tutne ki rehti hai jo local mechanic fix nahi kar sakta
@@PronixShortss to phir kaise solution hoga
Can we install fan regulator as well? What if the remote break or stop working due to some issue. How to control speed in that case?
Switch toggling to control fan speed, do not install the regulator, you can buy a new remote in case of any issue
Efficio or ikkano...which is better
Efficio built quality is better and motor also has some good weight, both have almost same air speed and delivery, Ikano model comes with Atomberg unique LED indicators
Airdilivery aur speed kiska jyada hai. Ikano or efficio.?
@@bahubalibahubalibahubali ikkano is the best
What if I put two or more Bldc fan in a hall , does single remote control all fans , if so then if I want to increase or decrease the speed of one fan then  will it do the same for another fan?
Yes single remote control all fans, if you want to increase or decrease the speed of only one fan put your hand around the remote control and point to only one fan"

Atomberg is the Best Fan in India!
मैं 23 जुलाई 2022 को atomberg का पंखा लिया जिसमे 2+1 वारंटी थी। वारंटी खत्म के एक दिन बाद 24 जुलाई को पंखा ने काम करना बंद कर दिया तो 25 को कंप्लेंट किया जिसपर  सर्विस प्रोवाइडर ने बताया कि PCB की एक IC जल गई है। तो पूरा PCB बदलेगा और खर्चा ₹950 के लगभग आएगा।
और नए PCB की गारंटी 3 महीने। अब BLDC पंखे बताया गया था कि पुराने पंखे से बेहतर है किंतु अनुभव खराब है। जितने में पुराने पंख आ जाते हैं उतने में खाली PCB चेंज वो भी हर 3 महीने पर। LED बल्ब के PCB रिपेयर हो जाते हैं पर BLDC का नही।

Atomberg is making noise. After frequent service , the noise is same. I think conventional fan are cheaper & good air supply.
Last month I went Sowcarpet, Chennai to buy 3 BLDC fans. I asked for Orient or Crompton fans, but shop owner convince me to buy Atomberg. I ignored his suggestion and brought fans in another shop.
Atomberg built and performance quality is too bad. But paid promoters are feeding fake information in social media. Be aware.
Crompton fan introduced 35 watts convention fan, which will replace BLDC and performance also good.
@@kavinkhumar3751 Should I go with Orient ujala prime bldc fan or atomberg renesa prime bldc fan? Thank you
Which conventional model from Crompton consumes 35 watts?
don't buy fans from Flipkart . There replacement policy is very messy and they will not replace at any cost. I bought 8 fans and my 2 fans were defective and Flipkart refuses to replace my order
@@gautamsinghrathore6304 50 + fan order no issue in brand fan 🙂
@@gautamsinghrathore6304 same with me also.they sent defactive fan and refused to return inspite of sending unboxing video.
Mera bhi Flipkart order on the way, plz suggest what I should do?
I have got defective fan.tried to replace but they refused.now after 1.8 year of use fan out of order.they have no policy to replace after company issued replacement letter no dealer accepting the letter saying you have not buyed from me so not going to give replacement.you have to go flipkart.
And there is a brand who invented the technology - Superfan. It’s not even in the list. Atomberg started making issues while superfan with extensive usage still runs better without any issues
Yes copy is more popular than original. Fake id more valuable than real. 😢
Best is conventional fan rock,long life  and sturdy for Indian power condition.
I have been using  superfan in three bedrooms for the past 12 years without any issues, recently bought a n Atomberg fan and had to return it immediately due to humming noise and swaying.

I am not convinced BLDc fan are energy saving my doubt is they are less air delivery and says energy saving.
Atomberg dont have good air delivery as I am using last one year if you seat under the fan then only u will feel cooling
same  problem with havells
I am Getting good Airflow no problem For me.Its the best fan forever❤❤❤
The mentioned KW is power consumption not the power......less KW means less power consumption and more savings on your electricity bill
Thank u very much.  It's very good comparison.
How come you neglected the Activa  BLDC fan brand by just showing negative comments.. I can show you a number of negative comments about all the four brands you mentioned.

No. In fact, using them without a regulator is better for power efficiency and the safety of the internal components of the fan. Mostly the power efficiency.

Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can't hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me
Kya kehna chahte ho bhai?😂
Color konsa hai?
Please please do not buy bldc fan.
Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai. Jo 20 sal tak bhi chal jata hai..  phir bldc jhatu lene ka kya fayda..???
Repair cost very high...1000-1300 rs approx 😢

Electricity bill se hi spare parts ke cost save ho gaye 😂
Thanks for the very detailed comparison!!
Bldc fan has many electronic components.  So its life expectancy is very short. It ie also very expensive to repair.
It has a simple rectifier circuit with built in surge protection and a speed controller. 

Nothing rocket science. 
Life expectancy is as long as you don’t get extreme surge currents (which in case of a normal fan generally burns the copper windings which is more expensive than repairing the rectifier circuit of a BLDC.
Hats off bro.. Very nice
Lovely explanation. Sweet & simple.
Very good comparison... Thanks...

I think not more then 7k, so don't worry and go for BLDC
I got normal fan for 1800, and power consumption is 42w

No.. koi sound nahi aata kisi bhi speed par.

Bro don't fool people. At cost of 1700 we csn get a normal fan with 56 watt energy consumption conpated to 32 watt BLDC fan. So it's expensive that too in long term as the money in my bank will also increase. BLDC is good but not the replacement for fans

I'm using 5 year old 3 atomberg fans and 2 super fan, atomberg is giving bearing and PCB issues when used for more than 12 hours in Hall but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use areas buy a fan with longer warranty period
Bakwas he mat lena

Atomberg ke fan 3 saal hi chalta he, kyoki ye chip me kaam karta he induction based nahi. Bldc bakwas he, 4000 ka fan kisi kam ka nahi, normal fan lo jo 1200ka ho
My fan has been working perfectly for 5 years, like new. I've basically gotten all my BLDC fans for free from the electricity savings.

Bhai atomberge ka renesa lu kya?
Renessa rpm low hai.. even at boost mode. Dusra koi problem nahi hai mene 3 sal ho gaye. Aap efficio hi lena vo bahut achha fan hai. Fast bhi ghumta hai.. mene design dekh kar renessa liya tha 5100rs ka. And 3400rs ka efficio liya tha.. Renessa dikhne me mast lagta hai par rpm low hai.
I'm using 5 year old 3 atomberg fans and 2 super fan, atomberg is giving bearing and PCB issues when used for more than 12 hours in Hall but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use areas buy a fan with longer warranty period
Bakwas he mat lena
Ayoo bro I am currently thinking of buying a hisense qled tv 43 inch to use as a Tv monitor can I use it and also ussi ko ghr wale kbhi kbhi tv bhi bana skte hai toh wo monitor kaam kar jaaiga na 120hz pr?
Atomberg ke fan 3 saal hi chalta he, kyoki ye chip me kaam karta he induction based nahi. Bldc bakwas he, 4000 ka fan kisi kam ka nahi, normal fan lo jo 1200ka ho
My fan has been working perfectly for 5 years, like new. I've basically gotten all my BLDC fans for free from the electricity savings.

I'm using 3 atomberg fans (5 years old) and 2 super fan, atomberg had 3 warranty claims in first 3 years due to faulty / melted PCB on 2 fans which were used in living room and recently at its 5th year started bearing failure costing 1500 rupees per fan and this is when used for more than 12 hours a day but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer as the 3rd fan had no issues.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use I prefer a BLDC fan with longer warranty period , but the Atomberg brand service is definitely descent in Chennai.
⚠️ I'm using atomberg Fan for 1 year Renesa Smart ceiling fan 1200mm( wifi support) & Renesa Regular ceiling fan 1200mm😔, Don't Buy this both model👎, wifi & Remote control feature is great 👍 but no air flow, only in 5 speed & Boost mode you'll feel the air with fan rotating noise, Think before you buy, Don't fall in trap
Atomberg Less air flow with energy savings,
I bought 3 atomberg fan now i regret it , Do not buy atomberg fan the material of the body very chip within a year it broke after complain they change it , three year of use all of my fan having issue speed goes up and down .
Think twice before buy atomberg
Dont waste your money on atomberg there is other choice in the market
I've 4 Atomberg fans and they are working good. Speed is decent and blow is also good. I've Aris, and Renesa both are studio smart. Would recommend
Great, thanks for sharing!
Common problem is replacement waste. These companies should provide replacement discount and take back old. BLDC will penitrate more than someone want new fan for new flats😢

Glad to be of help. 👍

Hello Saumya, Namaskara! I’m in the middle of a home makeover and in a unique position where I need to buy a fan, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and mixie. I spent this weekend watching your videos, and I must say they are incredibly interesting! Your in-depth research really stands out, and it clearly reflects in the quality of your content. Thank you for all the effort you put in—it’s been extremely helpful!
Namaskara! So glad to hear that 💜
Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don’t have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn’t as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won’t necessarily save you money — because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.
Is this the case with all BLDC Fan Manufacturers? Does PCB go quite often? What is the approx replacement / service costs that you incur everytime?
@@Kumar-zx8mj no, it's not often. I have 2 old Atomberg Gorilla series ceiling fan and they are running fine without any problem for last 8 years. I'll suggest you to go for the basic models instead of premium models as, the basic models last longer.

In case your PCB gone then, if you find a good electronics engineer, he can fix that at much lower cost instead replacing the faulty PCB. Generally it has 2 part, one SMPS module to convert AC to DC and a driver unit to run the brush-less motor. I had to change the driver unit once for a Atomberg Renesa Ceiling fan and it cost me about 700-800 rupees. For another pedestal model as Atomberg did not provide support saying it is discontinued, I purchased one PCB from Amazon which costs me about 1000 rupees and, I was able to fix that fan with help of that.
Quality Content, Point to Point Explanation 
Thanks 👍
Great Explanation and Quality Content,
recommend fans for kitchen or small rooms ❤
Thunderstorm resistance is my main concern when considering a BLDC fan, due to frequent lightning in my area during monsoon🥲
I must shortlist as this is the best comparison video I have ever seen
Good video mam
Looks you have put lot of effort to do it🎉🎉
Really curious, as of where KHUL fans stand in the competition and why.. can you share YOUR view point? BTW you do a fantastic job here, enlightening our knowledge base 👏🙏
Your efforts& research behind such a video is  commendable
Hi!

Do you have any recommendation for bread makers with bread pans that are not teflon coated
Used superfan, atomberg and crompton. One of my Superfan has been running for the past 10 years on top of it has india made motor. Found Crompton to be a bit glitchy, speed drops randomly. Also have an atomberg exhaust fan but noticed it has a Chinese motor. I personally find BLDC fans to be a bit noisy especially at lower speeds. A big plus for bldc fans is the speed regulation,it is accurate and steady as compared to the usual regulators that fail in a few months.
Thank you so much for making it! ❤
Very useful ! Love your explanation and the research gone behind it.
TY SO MUCH.  UR VIDEOS R TO GOOD. I BOUGHT BOSCH INDUCTION HOB AND GAS HOB AFTER WATCHING UR VIDEOS !!!!! THANKS A TONNEE !. GONNA FINALISE FANS TOO !!
Very helpful,  especially for regions with power cuts and require battery back up
@TheGrapevineIndia Any recommendations for 1400 mm? Also if we want same design in 900mm,1200mm and 1400mm?
Helpful Thanks, So less noise and better cooling means more money or more wings
I got Insight G for 3500 during the sale(offline) . This thing has everything except the smart app control. Best VFM for that price.
Great.
Which is best among Atomberg Renesa, Atomberg Renesa Prime remote & Atomberg Renesa halloo? ( Non smart)
Kuhl Twist is a great fan. Supports all modern features.
6:42 you have missed out considering Havells Fab (available online) & Havells Epic (available offline). Both have similar specs which are better than the specs of the products you have listed /! recommended & available at under 3K price bracket
Thanks for sharing. Will look into why it got missed and check where it falls in my recommendations. On first look, it does look equivalent to the ones recommended.
Good..pls do video on table fan as well..
what about super fan x1 model
What if the remote stops working ? Is there any option to control the fan speed with the regulator?can we switch it on using the regular switches?
Some has a feature by switch clicking we can increase speed accordingly...
Mam how is  Anchor's Panasonic Rosalyn Dynamic 1200mm BLDC Ceiling Fan with Remote, 5 Star Ceiling Fan with 6 Speed Control Remote, High Speed Ceiling Fan, Glossy White, 3 Yrs Warranty which also looks asthethically very nice at around Rs.5300/- value for money in premium segment of BLDC fans ? How does it fare with your recommended premium fans can you plz tell what is the difference? Which one should one should one buy for hall I have 156 sq ft hall and budget around 5k to 6k.
Can you suggest some budget decorative fans for the living room.
Thanks a lot for all the research and suggestions.  Setting up a new home so would use your affiliate links for maximum purchase.  

1400mm sweep size fans have bad ratings across brands at Amazon. Would you recommend any in budget?
Upfront saving in 10 years. Do you think bldc fans that too in 2025 where profits > reliability will let you run anything till 10 years ?
Any bldc ceiling fan without Remote? Wil operate in regulator only?
What about fans with underlights? Is there any fan with an underlight that does not strobe? Please let us know.
How about superfan q series mam. It covers 260cmm with 270rpm . Is it good?
Best fan

I bought Renesa+ 1400 mm for 194sq.ft. living room. The airflow is felt only below the fan. If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot. Noise is a bit more than normal fans.

Bhai 2 sal me hi kharab ho gaya..😢 aaj repairing wala aane wala hai dekhta hu kitna kharcha aata.
I bought atomberg halo  today i returned atomberg. Fan's rpm is low, does not justify its price
How to order?
Exactly
Hows the user experience?

Saving ⚡️ me 😊
Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can't hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me
Kya kehna chahte ho bhai?😂
Color konsa hai?
Please please do not buy bldc fan.
Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai. Jo 20 sal tak bhi chal jata hai..  phir bldc jhatu lene ka kya fayda..???
Repair cost very high...1000-1300 rs approx 😢

atomberg renesa smart vs renesa smart plus kya difference hai application support ka ya or kuch

                     Application support dono ka same hain koi difference nahi hain. ""Atomberg Home"" app se dono connect hota hain.

Is it possible to control speed of renesa smart through alexa? Like - ""alexa set fan speed 4""

This is atomberg renesa smart BLDC ceiling fan.

The speed of the fan will increase a lot after using it for a few days.
It is normal for a new fan to have low speed.

How is this fan, is this still in good condition?
Yes!
But there are few things you should know..., 
I am using two atomberg bldc fans... first one is 2.2 years old (atomberg renesa) and second one is 1.5 years old (atomberg renesa smart). Both fans are running absolutely fine in my case..., but my cousine is using renesa and facing PCB speed control issues from the beginning. 
                                   As per my knowledge, If you purchase it from a trusted and reliable shopping platform so you are less likely to get future issues.

Still not cooling me down in this heat ! just a bunch of strong air circulating heat! I should had grabbed the AC fan from
TikTok
Yeah you would need an AC for that! This will just move the air around your house!
Can the fan survive a really hard kick
umm we would not recommend kicking this fan or any fan for that matter... it is possible it would survive but no guarantee!
How you clean it ?
Compressed air when/if needed!
How much

Why does it keep moving around like a headless chicken 😂

Haha
ha!
Still not cooling me down in this heat ! just a bunch of strong air circulating heat! I should had grabbed the AC fan from
TikTok
Yeah you would need an AC for that! This will just move the air around your house!
Can the fan survive a really hard kick
umm we would not recommend kicking this fan or any fan for that matter... it is possible it would survive but no guarantee!
How you clean it ?
Compressed air when/if needed!

Their evaporative coolers work better in my opinion especially in dry hot areas like deserts or the southwest US. it uses a fan that pushes air through a wet filter, the evaporation cools the air slightly but not as good as an air conditioner. Good to use if you want to cool yourself a bit better but dont want to use the AC.
These will cause mold to grow in your house due to humidity, and can exacerbate any allergies one might have. They're to be used with caution.
@@techforever1970 thank you.
@@techforever1970 It won’t be as bad as you think, just gotta run an air conditioner with it and you should be fine. Mainly because air conditioners dehumidify.
This is better than Dyson at a great price point 💯
Dang that up and down would be nice for my girls who sleep on top and bottom bunks 😮
If it was battery operated it would run for a couple hours and then you have to buy a new fan when the battery ages
I've got 2 of these fans for my mom and I about over a year ago. My sister finally uses it, and she hate it. Now I'm gonna hate my brand new fan once I open it next year. 😂
Where’s the link?
i love big fans i have these with a tiny fan but can make it tall asf lmfao hate the companies that dont use their heads and make a good beefy sized fan thats actually cold
My issue is it does not alter high enough
Gfc fans are the best and very  pocket friendly
Is it a good fan I’m thinking of getting the desk top one!
My fan has been loosing wifi connection constantly. Uses 2.5ghz wifi not 5
Where is the pinned command
I use a tower fan that’s smart
It’s just a fan, uselessly priced with a useless app. My one cost a fraction and does the same, I just need to turn it on before sit down.
Hello, can I sue with home form apple?

Very nice
A battery is a bad idea for this
Never anything too remotely use 😅its a good until motherboard panel breakdown ,it will cost you more so better mannual one ,also when your fan get dusted and dirty you will face issues cleaning it ,buy if you r good 😅earner and don't care about money

No one is throwing anything at the camera. Thats so dramatic. It’s called covering the lens.

I bought atomberg halo  today i returned atomberg. Fan's rpm is low, does not justify its price
How to order?
Exactly
Hows the user experience?
only 1500 rupees per year?
Saving ⚡️ me 😊
Why now an average fan makes more noise that you can't hear sound from watching something on youtube of insta... I have to use headphone mostly or a Bluetooth speaker... 3000-4000 ka fan bhi itna sound krta hai jaise pehle k USha k panther nhi krte th or aaj bhi mast chal rhe hai Gaon me
Kya kehna chahte ho bhai?😂
Color konsa hai?
Please please do not buy bldc fan.
Me double pese dekar atomberg bldc fan le aaya tha.. electricity bill me ghanta kuchh farq nahi bada. 2.5  sal bad fan kharab ho gaya..ab repairing ka kharcha alag. Fan chalta bhi kachhua ke jese tha.. rpm very slow.  Aaj kal ke induction fan bhi to 50-60watt ke aate hai.. jo company ka bhi under 2k aa jata hai. Jo 20 sal tak bhi chal jata hai..  phir bldc jhatu lene ka kya fayda..???
Repair cost very high...1000-1300 rs approx 😢
When you buy when you repair

ha sahi bola aapne..., sirf smart wale fans me alexa and google assistant voice command ka option hain.
I have the same model but there are no voice command options in my app. Are you using Alexa with it?

atomberg renesa smart vs renesa smart plus kya difference hai application support ka ya or kuch
Atomberg Renesa smart and Atomberg Renesa smart plus ye dono ke andar kuch khaas difference nahi hain..., sirf Renesa smart plus ka blade ka design thoda alag hain.
                     Application support dono ka same hain koi difference nahi hain. ""Atomberg Home"" app se dono connect hota hain.

Thanks for your comment.
Acha ye fan mere room 250 se 300 sqft hai jisme window nhi hai sir ventilation ke liye par darwaza khol ke sote hai to kya thandi hawa dega ye
Atomberg renesa
This model is ""atomberg renesa smart"".
Kon se app se chala rhe ho bro?
""Atomberg home"" app se bro.
Bhai ye mere ghar me hai fan google assistant se control ho jata hai
wahh... 🙂 , aap ye fan kitne time se use kar rahe ho ?
Is it possible to control speed of renesa smart through alexa? Like - ""alexa set fan speed 4""
Yes, it is possible.
Please note- ""Atomberg home"" app is little slow and it takes time to configure the entire process.

Rensa prime me mobile connection ho raha hai kiya

""Renesa prime"" and ""Renesa prime remote"" dono ceiling fan me mobile(wifi/bluetooth) connectivity feature available nahi hain. 
                                                              But ""renesa prime remote"" wale model ko apne mobile phone ka IR(infra red) remote se connecct karke operate kar sakte hain.
Ji haa, mobile connection(bluetooth or wifi) feature available nahi hain.
This is atomberg Renesa smart
Yes, you are right!
This is atomberg renesa smart BLDC ceiling fan.
But fan speed is very low
The speed of the fan will increase a lot after using it for a few days.
It is normal for a new fan to have low speed.
Renesa plus have wifi or bluetooth facilities or not
""Renesa+"" don't have wifi or bluetooth feature.
""Renesa Smart+"" have the bluetooth and wifi feature.
Brother... please reply me... atomberg renesa model jo hai...not smart varient... Usko bhi app se ya phir Google se control kiya ja sakta hai kya...
Nahi brother..., atomberg renesa ko google assistant or alexa se control karna possible nahi hain!
                                           only IR(Infra Red) enabled mobile se control kar sakte ho aap.

@AmazingTechniqueGyan  bro bas tumhe mujhe apna video bhej dena jisse edit karna hai  aur apna voice ok
How is this fan, is this still in good condition?
Yes!
But there are few things you should know..., 
I am using two atomberg bldc fans... first one is 2.2 years old (atomberg renesa) and second one is 1.5 years old (atomberg renesa smart). Both fans are running absolutely fine in my case..., but my cousine is using renesa and facing PCB speed control issues from the beginning. 
                                   As per my knowledge, If you purchase it from a trusted and reliable shopping platform so you are less likely to get future issues.

Thanks!

Sound is too much
No  bro😢
bhai iska blades plastic ka hai?
Koi bhi fan ka blades plastic nahi rehta bhai
Service very poor
Toomuch noise
It's Because of air high rpm. If you need low noise then you need to go for low rpm with better aerodynamic blade fan still there will be air slicing noise of blades.

Renessa rpm low hai.. even at boost mode. Dusra koi problem nahi hai mene 3 sal ho gaye. Aap efficio hi lena vo bahut achha fan hai. Fast bhi ghumta hai.. mene design dekh kar renessa liya tha 5100rs ka. And 3400rs ka efficio liya tha.. Renessa dikhne me mast lagta hai par rpm low hai.
I'm using 5 year old 3 atomberg fans and 2 super fan, atomberg is giving bearing and PCB issues when used for more than 12 hours in Hall but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use areas buy a fan with longer warranty period
Bakwas he mat lena
Ayoo bro I am currently thinking of buying a hisense qled tv 43 inch to use as a Tv monitor can I use it and also ussi ko ghr wale kbhi kbhi tv bhi bana skte hai toh wo monitor kaam kar jaaiga na 120hz pr?
Atomberg ke fan 3 saal hi chalta he, kyoki ye chip me kaam karta he induction based nahi. Bldc bakwas he, 4000 ka fan kisi kam ka nahi, normal fan lo jo 1200ka ho
My fan has been working perfectly for 5 years, like new. I've basically gotten all my BLDC fans for free from the electricity savings.

I'm using 5 year old 3 atomberg fans and 2 super fan, atomberg is giving bearing and PCB issues when used for more than 12 hours in Hall but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use areas buy a fan with longer warranty period
Bakwas he mat lena
Ayoo bro I am currently thinking of buying a hisense qled tv 43 inch to use as a Tv monitor can I use it and also ussi ko ghr wale kbhi kbhi tv bhi bana skte hai toh wo monitor kaam kar jaaiga na 120hz pr?
Atomberg ke fan 3 saal hi chalta he, kyoki ye chip me kaam karta he induction based nahi. Bldc bakwas he, 4000 ka fan kisi kam ka nahi, normal fan lo jo 1200ka ho
My fan has been working perfectly for 5 years, like new. I've basically gotten all my BLDC fans for free from the electricity savings.
​@SumitYPF how ?

Atomberg bakwas hai circuit bar bar bigad jata hai and service is very poor hapto tak engineer visit nahi karte

BLDC means what? 
Inverter fan means will it work when there is no electricity

One Star – Extremely Disappointed with After-Sale Service

I rarely write reviews, but the after-sale service for this ceiling fan has been beyond frustrating. The fan itself worked fine for about a month, and then it started making a loud clicking noise. I contacted customer support, and that’s where the real nightmare began.

It took over a week just to get a response, and even then, it was a generic reply asking for details I had already provided. After multiple follow-ups, they finally agreed to send a technician—who never showed up. Rescheduled three times, and each time they either didn’t show up or cancelled last minute with no explanation.

It’s been nearly two months now, and the issue is still unresolved. I’ve wasted time, energy, and money on something that should’ve been a simple fix. Terrible customer service, no accountability, and zero urgency. I would NOT recommend this brand to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.

Finish your business in toilet 15 secs early tomorrow morning to compensate the loss of 15b secs.
And what about typing time
Exactly 💯
I personally used atomberg fan almost 2 years don't waste your money only remote control access it will take 10 sec to start. Air flow even not competitive with normal fans 
normal fans always give better air.
Atomberg ❤❤❤
The real comparison is remote controlled fan vs manually controlled fan

One Star – Extremely Disappointed with After-Sale Service

I rarely write reviews, but the after-sale service for this ceiling fan has been beyond frustrating. The fan itself worked fine for about a month, and then it started making a loud clicking noise. I contacted customer support, and that’s where the real nightmare began.

It took over a week just to get a response, and even then, it was a generic reply asking for details I had already provided. After multiple follow-ups, they finally agreed to send a technician—who never showed up. Rescheduled three times, and each time they either didn’t show up or cancelled last minute with no explanation.

It’s been nearly two months now, and the issue is still unresolved. I’ve wasted time, energy, and money on something that should’ve been a simple fix. Terrible customer service, no accountability, and zero urgency. I would NOT recommend this brand to anyone. Spend your money elsewhere.

I always thought they were a BIG FAILURE. Thank God they confirmed it..
the only design failure was the front panel that defeats the whole purpose. the motor was always awesome that atomberg provided. i have this fan and use it with that panel removed. they couldhve provided grill because not everything has to be minimalistic and boring. for what they offered the fan is dead silent and very very efficient (just 6 watts!)
How about if you don’t point the smoke directly at the exhaust, so we can see exactly how good it performs 🤔
Was thinking the same thing haha 😂
I planned to buy it in online. I am glad I went to  store and checked its function 😂. This is not a good exhaust fan as it has very low suction capacity which is the primary role of an exhaust rather than looks 😂. Think wisely and buy even efficio model of atomberg which has better suction
From so closeby.....even a computer cabinet fan will suck this much. This doesnt mean shot about how much air in a room it will move out in a certain space of time.

The PC burns for Lighting even when the switch is off, replaced board 3 times, 2 times in warranty and one paid 1300/- out of warranty.

Yeh sab fans AC room me chalane ke hote he. Garmi me bilkul bhi hawa nhi aayegi isse

Bilkul nahi bpdc sirf bill bachata hain hawa bekar hain

Bhai is type ke fans me sabse badi dikkat inke repairing me aati hai. Isme original repair possible nhi hota ya costly hota hai aur local wale technicians uska ready-made module laga ke de dete hai aur fir performance bilkul bekar ho jaata hai. Better ki aap Induction wale regular fan ko hi BLDC me convert kara le. Maximum 1200 se 1500 tak me ho jata hai. Uska bhi life iske jitna hi hota hai.

Noise boht hai ismein bakwas fan hai aur BLDC hone ke baad bhi normal fan ki tarah heat hota hai aur garam hawa phenkta hai kyonki iska PCB card andar band hai. Naam ki sadi hui LED lights hain bilkul dim, aur LED on karne par andar ka poori PCB plate dikhne lagti hai. Boht hi sada hua fab hai ye!

Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long.

bhai bahut hi jyada long lasting hai ..bus power supply 220-240 Voltage honi chahiye.. ek baar lagao aur bhool jaao .. mere ghar par 6 saal se jyada ho gaya humne 2019 diwali sale mei 8 fans khride the jab new ghar banaya tha.. ek bhi fan mei koi dikkat nahi aayi hai abhi tak itne mei to normal fan 2-3 baar udd jaata hai kitna bhi achha power supply kyu naa de do.. aur jitne power ek normal fan khata hai utne mei aap 3 BLDC fan chala skte ho aur hawaa bhi jyada achhi deta hai.. buss shuru shuru mei pocket par thoda bhari padta hai lekin 2 saal ke andar andar  extra diya paisa wasool karwaa deta hai aapko normal fan ki khad khad khad ki awaaz se pareshaan nahi hona padta neend bhi achhi aati hai
​@@NoamJudahh bhai sab bolte h pcb jal jaata h to aasani se nhi banta aur khrcha bahut jaayada aata h
to fir kese le ye?
​@@HyperMan_Ai voltage regular nahi milege to BLDC fan to chhodo normal fan tak jal jaata hai aur PCB ka tension nahi hai aap customer care ko call karke ya online sellers se khrid kar 500rs mei khud laga skte ho .. lekin phir bhi jaisa apne desh ki power supply hai usko dekhe to voltage stablizer aur Distrubution Box mei SPD 2 lage hone jaruri h.. mere ghar par to 2019 se lage huye h ek bhi fan mei dikkat nahi aayi h hum har saal ek baar sab fans mei Oil daal dete h uske alawa kuch nahi karte

कोई भी Fan Noiseless नहीं हो सकता। Noiseless का मतलब fan की मोटर की आवाज करने से है fan के ब्लेड हवा को काटेंगे तो आवाज होगी ही दुनिया के किसी भी फैन में।

I always thought they were a BIG FAILURE. Thank God they confirmed it..
the only design failure was the front panel that defeats the whole purpose. the motor was always awesome that atomberg provided. i have this fan and use it with that panel removed. they couldhve provided grill because not everything has to be minimalistic and boring. for what they offered the fan is dead silent and very very efficient (just 6 watts!)
How about if you don’t point the smoke directly at the exhaust, so we can see exactly how good it performs 🤔
Was thinking the same thing haha 😂
I planned to buy it in online. I am glad I went to  store and checked its function 😂. This is not a good exhaust fan as it has very low suction capacity which is the primary role of an exhaust rather than looks 😂. Think wisely and buy even efficio model of atomberg which has better suction
From so closeby.....even a computer cabinet fan will suck this much. This doesnt mean shot about how much air in a room it will move out in a certain space of time.
Itne paas te karoge to Mera 699 rupay wala exhaust bhi itna hi kaam karega😂😂😂

I always thought they were a BIG FAILURE. Thank God they confirmed it..
the only design failure was the front panel that defeats the whole purpose. the motor was always awesome that atomberg provided. i have this fan and use it with that panel removed. they couldhve provided grill because not everything has to be minimalistic and boring. for what they offered the fan is dead silent and very very efficient (just 6 watts!)
How about if you don’t point the smoke directly at the exhaust, so we can see exactly how good it performs 🤔
Was thinking the same thing haha 😂
I planned to buy it in online. I am glad I went to  store and checked its function 😂. This is not a good exhaust fan as it has very low suction capacity which is the primary role of an exhaust rather than looks 😂. Think wisely and buy even efficio model of atomberg which has better suction
From so closeby.....even a computer cabinet fan will suck this much. This doesnt mean shot about how much air in a room it will move out in a certain space of time.
Itne paas te karoge to Mera 699 rupay wala exhaust bhi itna hi kaam karega😂😂😂
😲 wow amazing
Thank you 😅

Atomberg is a costly but yet very reliable product....i have 2 fans of atomberg for 5 years and they work fine and have less electricity bill.
You sure?
Can this be used in kitchen?
Yes, definitely this 6"" ventilation fan has one of the highest air speed in market
Comparing with aerauliqa / elta trade fan better to buy gm fans

Any exhaust at that distance works with the same power. Nothing unusual.
Wrong.... fireworks smoke direction street to fan side.....it will collect air in some /limited areas

Atomberg is making noise. After frequent service , the noise is same. I think conventional fan are cheaper & good air supply.
Last month I went Sowcarpet, Chennai to buy 3 BLDC fans. I asked for Orient or Crompton fans, but shop owner convince me to buy Atomberg. I ignored his suggestion and brought fans in another shop.
Atomberg built and performance quality is too bad. But paid promoters are feeding fake information in social media. Be aware.
Crompton fan introduced 35 watts convention fan, which will replace BLDC and performance also good.

I'm using 3 atomberg fans (5 years old) and 2 super fan, atomberg had 3 warranty claims in first 3 years due to faulty / melted PCB on 2 fans which were used in living room and recently at its 5th year started bearing failure costing 1500 rupees per fan and this is when used for more than 12 hours a day but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer as the 3rd fan had no issues.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use I prefer a BLDC fan with longer warranty period , but the Atomberg brand service is definitely descent in Chennai.
⚠️ I'm using atomberg Fan for 1 year Renesa Smart ceiling fan 1200mm( wifi support) & Renesa Regular ceiling fan 1200mm😔, Don't Buy this both model👎, wifi & Remote control feature is great 👍 but no air flow, only in 5 speed & Boost mode you'll feel the air with fan rotating noise, Think before you buy, Don't fall in trap
Atomberg Less air flow with energy savings,
I bought 3 atomberg fan now i regret it , Do not buy atomberg fan the material of the body very chip within a year it broke after complain they change it , three year of use all of my fan having issue speed goes up and down .
Think twice before buy atomberg
Dont waste your money on atomberg there is other choice in the market
I've 4 Atomberg fans and they are working good. Speed is decent and blow is also good. I've Aris, and Renesa both are studio smart. Would recommend
Great, thanks for sharing!
Common problem is replacement waste. These companies should provide replacement discount and take back old. BLDC will penitrate more than someone want new fan for new flats😢

Thanks for sharing!
Hello Saumya, Namaskara! I’m in the middle of a home makeover and in a unique position where I need to buy a fan, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and mixie. I spent this weekend watching your videos, and I must say they are incredibly interesting! Your in-depth research really stands out, and it clearly reflects in the quality of your content. Thank you for all the effort you put in—it’s been extremely helpful!
Namaskara! So glad to hear that 💜
Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don’t have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn’t as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won’t necessarily save you money — because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.
Is this the case with all BLDC Fan Manufacturers? Does PCB go quite often? What is the approx replacement / service costs that you incur everytime?
@@Kumar-zx8mj no, it's not often. I have 2 old Atomberg Gorilla series ceiling fan and they are running fine without any problem for last 8 years. I'll suggest you to go for the basic models instead of premium models as, the basic models last longer.

In case your PCB gone then, if you find a good electronics engineer, he can fix that at much lower cost instead replacing the faulty PCB. Generally it has 2 part, one SMPS module to convert AC to DC and a driver unit to run the brush-less motor. I had to change the driver unit once for a Atomberg Renesa Ceiling fan and it cost me about 700-800 rupees. For another pedestal model as Atomberg did not provide support saying it is discontinued, I purchased one PCB from Amazon which costs me about 1000 rupees and, I was able to fix that fan with help of that.
Quality Content, Point to Point Explanation 
Thanks 👍
Great Explanation and Quality Content,
recommend fans for kitchen or small rooms ❤
Thunderstorm resistance is my main concern when considering a BLDC fan, due to frequent lightning in my area during monsoon🥲
I must shortlist as this is the best comparison video I have ever seen
Good video mam
Looks you have put lot of effort to do it🎉🎉
Really curious, as of where KHUL fans stand in the competition and why.. can you share YOUR view point? BTW you do a fantastic job here, enlightening our knowledge base 👏🙏
Your efforts& research behind such a video is  commendable
Hi!

Do you have any recommendation for bread makers with bread pans that are not teflon coated
Used superfan, atomberg and crompton. One of my Superfan has been running for the past 10 years on top of it has india made motor. Found Crompton to be a bit glitchy, speed drops randomly. Also have an atomberg exhaust fan but noticed it has a Chinese motor. I personally find BLDC fans to be a bit noisy especially at lower speeds. A big plus for bldc fans is the speed regulation,it is accurate and steady as compared to the usual regulators that fail in a few months.
Thank you so much for making it! ❤
Very useful ! Love your explanation and the research gone behind it.
TY SO MUCH.  UR VIDEOS R TO GOOD. I BOUGHT BOSCH INDUCTION HOB AND GAS HOB AFTER WATCHING UR VIDEOS !!!!! THANKS A TONNEE !. GONNA FINALISE FANS TOO !!
Very helpful,  especially for regions with power cuts and require battery back up
@TheGrapevineIndia Any recommendations for 1400 mm? Also if we want same design in 900mm,1200mm and 1400mm?
Helpful Thanks, So less noise and better cooling means more money or more wings
I got Insight G for 3500 during the sale(offline) . This thing has everything except the smart app control. Best VFM for that price.
Great.
Which is best among Atomberg Renesa, Atomberg Renesa Prime remote & Atomberg Renesa halloo? ( Non smart)
Kuhl Twist is a great fan. Supports all modern features.
6:42 you have missed out considering Havells Fab (available online) & Havells Epic (available offline). Both have similar specs which are better than the specs of the products you have listed /! recommended & available at under 3K price bracket
Thanks for sharing. Will look into why it got missed and check where it falls in my recommendations. On first look, it does look equivalent to the ones recommended.
Good..pls do video on table fan as well..
what about super fan x1 model
What if the remote stops working ? Is there any option to control the fan speed with the regulator?can we switch it on using the regular switches?
Some has a feature by switch clicking we can increase speed accordingly...
Mam how is  Anchor's Panasonic Rosalyn Dynamic 1200mm BLDC Ceiling Fan with Remote, 5 Star Ceiling Fan with 6 Speed Control Remote, High Speed Ceiling Fan, Glossy White, 3 Yrs Warranty which also looks asthethically very nice at around Rs.5300/- value for money in premium segment of BLDC fans ? How does it fare with your recommended premium fans can you plz tell what is the difference? Which one should one should one buy for hall I have 156 sq ft hall and budget around 5k to 6k.
Can you suggest some budget decorative fans for the living room.
Thanks a lot for all the research and suggestions.  Setting up a new home so would use your affiliate links for maximum purchase.  

1400mm sweep size fans have bad ratings across brands at Amazon. Would you recommend any in budget?

Hi what is your view of Havells Stealth Air
The superfan has the low rpm compared to atomberg compare and see the fans and give suggedtions
Rpm is not the only aspect to consider ☺️
If you had mentioned the noise level bB it would have been nice comparison
Thanks
Can u do a video of electricity consumption of lg dryers… I bought lg dryer but I don’t know which mode uses low electricity… please help
Hello Saumya Maam, Which Fan do you suggest for the quietest performance with electricity saving , I am ok spending little more on the purchase
Surprised you didn't mention Goldmedal fans, especially the Opus Prime model with 5 years warranty. 215 CMM , 350 RPM and 30W power consumption.
Can i consider LONGWAY company BLDC fan. Please suggest.
Taught of buying atomberg aris starlight instead of aris contour my main goal is high air delivery and air delivery is utmost important can I buy this BLDC fan is aris starlight or any other please recommend
Atomberg has stopped manufacturing the Renesa model.💔",,NDKD-B_i3mg,"❄Airflow vs noise – What’s more important to you in a fan?
Click here 👆for best ceiling fans https://amzn.to/4bMNptr
I'm using 3 atomberg fans (5 years old) and 2 super fan, atomberg had 3 warranty claims in first 3 years due to faulty / melted PCB on 2 fans which were used in living room and recently at its 5th year started bearing failure costing 1500 rupees per fan and this is when used for more than 12 hours a day but when used in bedrooms for 6 to 8 hours the fan life is longer as the 3rd fan had no issues.
Super fan has longer warranty of 5 years so for heavy use I prefer a BLDC fan with longer warranty period , but the Atomberg brand service is definitely descent in Chennai.
⚠️ I'm using atomberg Fan for 1 year Renesa Smart ceiling fan 1200mm( wifi support) & Renesa Regular ceiling fan 1200mm😔, Don't Buy this both model👎, wifi & Remote control feature is great 👍 but no air flow, only in 5 speed & Boost mode you'll feel the air with fan rotating noise, Think before you buy, Don't fall in trap
Atomberg Less air flow with energy savings,
I bought 3 atomberg fan now i regret it , Do not buy atomberg fan the material of the body very chip within a year it broke after complain they change it , three year of use all of my fan having issue speed goes up and down .
Think twice before buy atomberg
Dont waste your money on atomberg there is other choice in the market
I've 4 Atomberg fans and they are working good. Speed is decent and blow is also good. I've Aris, and Renesa both are studio smart. Would recommend
Great, thanks for sharing!
Common problem is replacement waste. These companies should provide replacement discount and take back old. BLDC will penitrate more than someone want new fan for new flats😢
Truee
For the first time I felt that I have to click on the affiliate link in the video to buy a product. Very useful information. Thank you. Ordered atomberg via your link
Glad to be of help. 👍
6:13 Recently I bought this Activa Gracia fan, It has Reverse Mode.
This fan is very good. But not experienced about customer service till now
Thanks for sharing!
Hello Saumya, Namaskara! I’m in the middle of a home makeover and in a unique position where I need to buy a fan, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and mixie. I spent this weekend watching your videos, and I must say they are incredibly interesting! Your in-depth research really stands out, and it clearly reflects in the quality of your content. Thank you for all the effort you put in—it’s been extremely helpful!
Namaskara! So glad to hear that 💜
Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don’t have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn’t as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won’t necessarily save you money — because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.
Is this the case with all BLDC Fan Manufacturers? Does PCB go quite often? What is the approx replacement / service costs that you incur everytime?
@@Kumar-zx8mj no, it's not often. I have 2 old Atomberg Gorilla series ceiling fan and they are running fine without any problem for last 8 years. I'll suggest you to go for the basic models instead of premium models as, the basic models last longer.

In case your PCB gone then, if you find a good electronics engineer, he can fix that at much lower cost instead replacing the faulty PCB. Generally it has 2 part, one SMPS module to convert AC to DC and a driver unit to run the brush-less motor. I had to change the driver unit once for a Atomberg Renesa Ceiling fan and it cost me about 700-800 rupees. For another pedestal model as Atomberg did not provide support saying it is discontinued, I purchased one PCB from Amazon which costs me about 1000 rupees and, I was able to fix that fan with help of that.
Quality Content, Point to Point Explanation 
Thanks 👍
Great Explanation and Quality Content,
recommend fans for kitchen or small rooms ❤
Thunderstorm resistance is my main concern when considering a BLDC fan, due to frequent lightning in my area during monsoon🥲
I must shortlist as this is the best comparison video I have ever seen
Good video mam
Looks you have put lot of effort to do it🎉🎉
Really curious, as of where KHUL fans stand in the competition and why.. can you share YOUR view point? BTW you do a fantastic job here, enlightening our knowledge base 👏🙏
Your efforts& research behind such a video is  commendable
Hi!

Do you have any recommendation for bread makers with bread pans that are not teflon coated
Used superfan, atomberg and crompton. One of my Superfan has been running for the past 10 years on top of it has india made motor. Found Crompton to be a bit glitchy, speed drops randomly. Also have an atomberg exhaust fan but noticed it has a Chinese motor. I personally find BLDC fans to be a bit noisy especially at lower speeds. A big plus for bldc fans is the speed regulation,it is accurate and steady as compared to the usual regulators that fail in a few months.
Thank you so much for making it! ❤
Very useful ! Love your explanation and the research gone behind it.
TY SO MUCH.  UR VIDEOS R TO GOOD. I BOUGHT BOSCH INDUCTION HOB AND GAS HOB AFTER WATCHING UR VIDEOS !!!!! THANKS A TONNEE !. GONNA FINALISE FANS TOO !!
Very helpful,  especially for regions with power cuts and require battery back up
@TheGrapevineIndia Any recommendations for 1400 mm? Also if we want same design in 900mm,1200mm and 1400mm?
Helpful Thanks, So less noise and better cooling means more money or more wings
I got Insight G for 3500 during the sale(offline) . This thing has everything except the smart app control. Best VFM for that price.
Great.
Which is best among Atomberg Renesa, Atomberg Renesa Prime remote & Atomberg Renesa halloo? ( Non smart)
Kuhl Twist is a great fan. Supports all modern features.
6:42 you have missed out considering Havells Fab (available online) & Havells Epic (available offline). Both have similar specs which are better than the specs of the products you have listed /! recommended & available at under 3K price bracket
Thanks for sharing. Will look into why it got missed and check where it falls in my recommendations. On first look, it does look equivalent to the ones recommended.
Good..pls do video on table fan as well..
what about super fan x1 model
What if the remote stops working ? Is there any option to control the fan speed with the regulator?can we switch it on using the regular switches?
Some has a feature by switch clicking we can increase speed accordingly...
Mam how is  Anchor's Panasonic Rosalyn Dynamic 1200mm BLDC Ceiling Fan with Remote, 5 Star Ceiling Fan with 6 Speed Control Remote, High Speed Ceiling Fan, Glossy White, 3 Yrs Warranty which also looks asthethically very nice at around Rs.5300/- value for money in premium segment of BLDC fans ? How does it fare with your recommended premium fans can you plz tell what is the difference? Which one should one should one buy for hall I have 156 sq ft hall and budget around 5k to 6k.
Can you suggest some budget decorative fans for the living room.
Thanks a lot for all the research and suggestions.  Setting up a new home so would use your affiliate links for maximum purchase.  

1400mm sweep size fans have bad ratings across brands at Amazon. Would you recommend any in budget?
Upfront saving in 10 years. Do you think bldc fans that too in 2025 where profits > reliability will let you run anything till 10 years ?

Loose fitting
Manufacturing defect mechanically.
Poor machining quality, concentricity issues in housing and poor assembly skill,  balancing   not done. Wobbling is not at all acceptable.
The problem is with installation and not the fan itself. If you see, the mount is not secure
THE mount is perfectly secure. get your eyes tested .
Correct. It's not secure. @its_jyvn  seems like you have no idea about the installation process
@rajahm507  the mount to the ceiling is obviously secured. The hinge mount is not properly tightened
@@rajahm507 it's you who doesn't have any idea about the installation process
@@j_0.05  6 fans install kia hai ghar pe , no problem with a single fan. please gyan maat jharo
My 1400mm Renesas fan had the same issue. I reinstalled the fan three times, thinking there might be something loose in the shackle or that the nut and bolt weren't tight. However, it turned out to be an issue with the fan itself. Additionally, the wobbling of the fan became worse at slower speeds. So, I contacted Amazon for a replacement, and they sent me a new unit which I installed today. The new fan is working perfectly fine with no wobble.

 The people in comment section acting as if they are expert but they know nothing. If you have received a good unit that doesn't mean everyone has good unit and from what i have read from online reviews it is a common problem with all atomberg models company should focus on quality control but i think atomberg is focusing more towards making profit first they removed separate psu from fan and when i received the fan the bottom canopy of fan was smaller in size compared to top which was not the case with previous fans they also removed safety wire from fans this is pure greed
I too bought renesa 1400mm and found the minimal wobbling issue, reinstalled it few times but it never corrected. Just left it as it. 
Actually I didn't had any idea of wobbling issue as manufacturing defect and accepted as it is. However reading your experience I will keep this point in my mind for future.
Removed safety wire????!
Right motor he nhi sahi iska
The balancing of atomberg fan motor is not good
I am facing the same issue, the down is defective and due to that it is causing wobble but flopkart is not ready to do return or exchange. Looks like the issue is with the down rod pipe which is of very low quality and thickness that causes it to deform while tightening the fan and hence it wobbles. I installed the fan using an old down rod and it was rock solid. This company is making cost at every level to increase the profit margin. I have 3 year old Atomberg efficio fan which is quite sturdier than these renesa series fans. Efficio works like a charm, has better air flow and stays rock stable even better than conventional fans.
I am using this fan since years and no problelm occured ...once the motor got complaint and the atom berg agents camed here and repaired it ...there customer support is also very good ..its a nice fan ..
I had no issues for more than 2 years...
How can claim the warrenty can u plz help me?
Do you turn off fan from main switch or only from remote ?
Why autoberg company not responding bldc fan stopped working since 2 months nobody repair it local cheep quality don't buy
Fans from reputed manufacturers are so balanced that if you just hold the fan by your finger it won't wobble.
Tera ye fan kis company ka ha bhai😂
Bro if there is a defect get it exchanged.
1 Indian doesn't define India.
1 fan doesn't define company
The hinge to the fan is not tightened and it maybe damaged, not the fault of atomberg or the technicians if the customer has a shtty house

Loose fitting
Manufacturing defect mechanically.
Poor machining quality, concentricity issues in housing and poor assembly skill,  balancing   not done. Wobbling is not at all acceptable.
The problem is with installation and not the fan itself. If you see, the mount is not secure
THE mount is perfectly secure. get your eyes tested .
Correct. It's not secure. @its_jyvn  seems like you have no idea about the installation process
@rajahm507  the mount to the ceiling is obviously secured. The hinge mount is not properly tightened
@@rajahm507 it's you who doesn't have any idea about the installation process
@@j_0.05  6 fans install kia hai ghar pe , no problem with a single fan. please gyan maat jharo
My 1400mm Renesas fan had the same issue. I reinstalled the fan three times, thinking there might be something loose in the shackle or that the nut and bolt weren't tight. However, it turned out to be an issue with the fan itself. Additionally, the wobbling of the fan became worse at slower speeds. So, I contacted Amazon for a replacement, and they sent me a new unit which I installed today. The new fan is working perfectly fine with no wobble.

 The people in comment section acting as if they are expert but they know nothing. If you have received a good unit that doesn't mean everyone has good unit and from what i have read from online reviews it is a common problem with all atomberg models company should focus on quality control but i think atomberg is focusing more towards making profit first they removed separate psu from fan and when i received the fan the bottom canopy of fan was smaller in size compared to top which was not the case with previous fans they also removed safety wire from fans this is pure greed
I too bought renesa 1400mm and found the minimal wobbling issue, reinstalled it few times but it never corrected. Just left it as it. 
Actually I didn't had any idea of wobbling issue as manufacturing defect and accepted as it is. However reading your experience I will keep this point in my mind for future.
Removed safety wire????!
Right motor he nhi sahi iska
The balancing of atomberg fan motor is not good
I am facing the same issue, the down is defective and due to that it is causing wobble but flopkart is not ready to do return or exchange. Looks like the issue is with the down rod pipe which is of very low quality and thickness that causes it to deform while tightening the fan and hence it wobbles. I installed the fan using an old down rod and it was rock solid. This company is making cost at every level to increase the profit margin. I have 3 year old Atomberg efficio fan which is quite sturdier than these renesa series fans. Efficio works like a charm, has better air flow and stays rock stable even better than conventional fans.
I am using this fan since years and no problelm occured ...once the motor got complaint and the atom berg agents camed here and repaired it ...there customer support is also very good ..its a nice fan ..
I had no issues for more than 2 years...
How can claim the warrenty can u plz help me?
Do you turn off fan from main switch or only from remote ?
Why autoberg company not responding bldc fan stopped working since 2 months nobody repair it local cheep quality don't buy
Fans from reputed manufacturers are so balanced that if you just hold the fan by your finger it won't wobble.
Tera ye fan kis company ka ha bhai😂
Bro if there is a defect get it exchanged.
1 Indian doesn't define India.
1 fan doesn't define company
The hinge to the fan is not tightened and it maybe damaged, not the fault of atomberg or the technicians if the customer has a shtty house

Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long.

I want to buy at least three fans for my new house. Which one do you think I should buy?
Go for superfan, first BLDC fan and best

Reason?? ​@@yogaomega5850
I have problem with this fan. Mera fan kavi ruk jata hai kavi aap se aap chala jata hai. What is the problem? I am very sad from this company how to sholve my problem ? pl help me",,u_kxhHjHln0,"I bought Renesa+ 1400 mm for 194sq.ft. living room. The airflow is felt only below the fan. If you step one feet away from the fan, there is no airflow. Atomberg technician says that Renesa, plus and smart series get a lot of customer complaints but Efficio has no complaints so far. Overall, BLDC 1400 mm fan for a bigger size living room, is not a good choice. I used Orient 52W 1400mm fan earlier and it delivered good airflow. Its heavy duty fan and would last long. Regular 1400 mm fans from Crompton, Havells, Orient, Bajaj are best choices. I have Renesa 1200 mm fans in two bedrooms and its good as the fan is directly above the cot. Noise is a bit more than normal fans.

if bldc 1.5 kg fan can collapse Then also imagine normal 3 kg fan will collapse with double speed 😂

Don't buy BLDC or whatever technology....It saves energy more efficiently than traditional fan but once it stops working your repairing cost is more than whatever you have saved in energy, especially Automberg after sales is very poor ..... Think before buy.....

Indian populace who haven't used bldc fans still think HIGH RPM means High air delivery. It's not. High RPM only causes High Noise and low air delivery while consuming more power. A good modern fan should consume less power and Deliver MORE AIR DOWNWARD WITH LESS RPM this having low noise and smooth breeze like air throughout the room. These fans deliver that much air with much less RPM hence they are great to have. 
This more blade fans are for cold environment is a false thought that most Indians who haven't used such a appliance think but once they experience it they understand why it's better and why it's SO EXPENSIVE. 
The price is it's only downside.
@@debdulalsenapati1391 either you have not used multi blade fan or you have very low ceiling small room.
@@vishalpratap6991 I have not used 8 blade BLDC fan yet but have used 6 blade one in a Regular 14*13 room and the air throughput of a 6 blade dc fan is quite good along with another 4 blade BLDC fan I use. I feel both provide almost equal air delivery but the 6 blade one does it in lower RPM. That's my observation of it. 
Theoretically and as Written on the specs a 8 blade fan will provide similar air delivery at  a Slightly lower or equal as 6 blade air delivery. That's what I think it will be judging by the 6 blade performance but I feel a 6 blade fan is enough in place of 8 blade. 

The goal is to run the fan in lower RPM and get a nice Air Circulation Breeze instead of having High RPM Noise and irregular hot n cold air circulation in the Room.  

Do tell about  your Experience of any higher blade fan experience.

@@debdulalsenapati1391 either you have not used multi blade fan or you have very low ceiling small room.
@@vishalpratap6991 I have not used 8 blade BLDC fan yet but have used 6 blade one in a Regular 14*13 room and the air throughput of a 6 blade dc fan is quite good along with another 4 blade BLDC fan I use. I feel both provide almost equal air delivery but the 6 blade one does it in lower RPM. That's my observation of it. 
Theoretically and as Written on the specs a 8 blade fan will provide similar air delivery at  a Slightly lower or equal as 6 blade air delivery. That's what I think it will be judging by the 6 blade performance but I feel a 6 blade fan is enough in place of 8 blade. 

The goal is to run the fan in lower RPM and get a nice Air Circulation Breeze instead of having High RPM Noise and irregular hot n cold air circulation in the Room.  

Do tell about  your Experience of any higher blade fan experience.
@@vishalpratap6991 ohh and my ceiling is at 12feet.
@@vishalpratap6991yes this fan is very very slow . I am using 6 blades one worst Electronic purchase ever in my life. Not at all satisfied
fan hai ya makdi😂😂 8 pairo wali achha dikh raha hai vaise
Lol its premium fan it runs slow with sufficient air delivery approx fan weight more then 10kg .. it operate through iot alexa enable with Remote. Light, bldc motor, 5yr warranty and it runs clock and anticlockwise both nice fan not for local people.. fans suitable for rich people it suit only for big house like villa and bungalows only ...😅
Chalte time ese lagta hoga jese helicopter udan bhar rha ho
I am looking to buy this fan but m a bit confused between this and the Galaxis G8 fan which has similar features but is much bigger at 1700mm. Can you please give a full review of this with speed 1 to 5 each 10 second run ?!
Very slow.. i am already using having 6 wings.. go for another one
air throw kaisa he bhai? Amazon par negative reviews he
This fan is only good for high air circulation and zero noise operation, its speed is really low
Not good
Still confused if these multi blade fans are better than everyday fans we see

Atomberg Renesa Smart, it is a brand new model. You can buy this from ""amazon"", don't buy this from flipkart..., because flipkart is sending faulty and refurbised product now a days... and they do not even approve return request!

atomberg renesa smart vs renesa smart plus kya difference hai application support ka ya or kuch

How is this fan, is this still in good condition?
Yes!
But there are few things you should know..., 
I am using two atomberg bldc fans... first one is 2.2 years old (atomberg renesa) and second one is 1.5 years old (atomberg renesa smart). Both fans are running absolutely fine in my case..., but my cousine is using renesa and facing PCB speed control issues from the beginning. 
                                   As per my knowledge, If you purchase it from a trusted and reliable shopping platform so you are less likely to get future issues.

Thanks!

Wasted this fan is. No Breeze at all
Orient thunderstorm fans.. super fan bldc ceiling fan.. crompton air 360 ceiling fan. . Jv luker ceiling fan.. tvs lucas bldc ceiling fan.. luminous exhaust fan.. performance is also best
Price sir warranty
Local quality, plastic body fan cheaper than chinese quality fan, better to buy branded company like crompton, orient, havells, check quality before buying atomberg
Worst fan don't buy this
Does ikano have toggle switch speed control like renasa model  ? Like for example if we toggle the main power switch 3 times the fan speed will be at 2nd speed
I have checked now. That doesn’t seem working in this model.

Please do not buy atomberg fan if you have hard earned money , wobbles and makes lot of sound. Only remote is good which is probably imported from china.
No
